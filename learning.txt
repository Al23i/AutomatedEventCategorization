This summer we’re offering two separate weeks of Blues Camp for high school age musicians on any instrument.

Puppet camp is back at C4A for 2012!  This year we’re offering 2 sessions: Staged puppets and BIG puppets.
Session 1: Staged Puppets
This session features imagining, building, and operating smaller sized hand puppets.  We’ll create a story and work on staging–including action, lighting, scenery, props, sound effects–for a nice production at the end of the week to entertain and delight our family and friends! To build our puppets we’ll use a sock as the foundation.  Sock puppets can be very simple or as complex as you like! (Kermit the Frog is a sock puppet.) They are easy to work with and have infinite expressive capacity.  With a few basic moves we can create facial expressions to reflect our character’s personality. With more intricate moves we can attain subtleties that human actors would envy! Other activities during the week will include viewing and deconstructing videos of puppets, and discussion about the history of puppets with a survey of famous sock puppets and puppeteers.
Session 2: BIG Puppets
BIG puppets pretty much says what we have in mind for this one–we’ll create larger-than-life characters then take to the streets for a Parade &amp; Pageant at the week’s end.  (Weather permitting, this will be an outdoor event.) Although facial expressiveness with really giant puppets is limited, we will explore other ways to communicate with our puppets by using the way they move through space and interact with one another. This session will also include  historic uses of puppets, with a focus on larger specimens!
Session 1: June 11-15; 9am to 3pm
Session 2: July 9-13; 9am to 3pm
Ages 6-10, or with consent of instructor.
Located at C4A Studios, room 226.

As many of you know, this month has been dedicated to following around 22 teams of committed and talented riders from around the world while they race through France and neighboring countries in Le Tour de France.  Watching the race is both breath-taking and nerve-racking at the same time.  If you haven&#39;t had enough from the coverage of this year&#39;s race, and for a closer look at the race, join us for a screening of the amazing &#34;Chasing Legends&#34; which covers Le Tour de France in 2009, from the perspective of Team Columbia  - HTC.

Not only has the film won several awards, but the flimmaker is local Arlington resident Jason Berry with Gripped Flims!  So show your support for bikes and Arlington and enjoy some refreshments (we&#39;ll bring the popcorn) while watching an intense and adrenaline filled film! 
If you haven&#39;t had enough, we&#39;ll make our way to Carpool for some drinks and the opportunity to talk to the filmmaker himself!
 
&#34;Experience the Passion, the Pain and the Triumph of the Tour de France.&#34;A Latin inspired workout specially designed to help adults with weight loss and toning. Come have fun and improve your health and wellness.
Zumba Cardio FREE every 1st Saturday of the month at 10:00 a.m.Drupal4Gov Event!
This event is in the planning stage and will be updated as we move forward.
 
If you would like to present a session at the event, please email Kirsten.Burgard2@va.gov.  Sessions selected will be based on the most applicable usage of the Digital Strategy. So, if you&#39;re working with another agency on an open source project, working on the Drupal4Gov Ladder or have a cool concept that you want to work on with other agencies, these are the kinds of sessions we&#39;re looking for. It doesn&#39;t matter if you want to teach Views configuration or provide a lesson on php coding or even a cloud based discussion, your focus on the digital strategy is what matters most.
 
For the future, if you have an idea for a code project, want to lead a documentation sprint project or offer some other hands-on exercises, drop me a line at kirsten.burgard2@va.gov so that we can develop a Drupal4Gov event at your agency around those topics (or at another agency if you&#39;re unable to host).
 
What Do I Need to Bring?

Laptops (not always a requirement)
ID to enter building
Paper and pen so you can move about the room or simply to take notes
Business cards so you can connect after the event

Make the most of your week-end by getting an early start to your day. We start shooting just as the sun comes up, capturing Magic Hour at one of the world&#39;s most spectacular monuments - the Lincoln Memorial.  We&#39;ll show you how to photograph the Korean War Veteran&#39;s Memorial to portray the unique feeling of &quot;being there.&quot;  We&#39;ll go to the banks of the mighty Potomac River to shoot the historic Arlington Memorial bridge and if we&#39;re lucky see rowers gliding by.  Next, we record the brilliant golden Art of War statues and end our outing interpeting the somber tones of the Franklin D Roosevelt Memorial.
 
Magic Hour is a film term used for the first and last hours of sunlight during the day, when the light is beautiful and the colors are magical. Ask anyone in the business and they&#39;ll tell you: &quot;No matter what you&#39;re shooting, it&#39;s always better when you shoot at Magic Hour.&quot; Come on! Let&#39;s beat the crowd and focus on making prize-winning images!" class="notranslateCrunching numbers into Prize-winners

The NPC Journalism Institute is announcing its Data-Powered Journalism Series. The Institute will be hosting a progressive series of training sessions in the coming weeks on how spreadsheets and databases can add a valuable new dimension to Washington stories.

Sign up now to master the skills that take you beyond great interviewing and document digging. The sessions will be divided into three classes, starting in late May. Admission is $5 for members per class, $25 for non-members per class. Space is limited, so please reserve early. Each session will start at 9:00 a.m. and end at 12:00 p.m. 

May 29 - Part I: Don’t fear the math: Turning numbers into stories and stories into award-winnersExcel is more than a program for doing your expenses. It can be a powerful tool for understanding how things work on your beat, following the campaign money and holding accountable the officials who spend our tax dollars. This introduction to Excel class will show how just a little number-crunching can improve both deadline stories and bigger projects.June 25 - Part II: Excel-ing at data reportingUsing powerful spreadsheet tools like pivot tables can give you the advantage of knowledge. Want to take the smug press secretary down a notch? With a few clicks of the mouse and a spreadsheet, you can show him that you know more about the subject than him or his boss. It’s not that easy, of course, but this advanced Excel class will help you get a leg up on your sources.Participation requires completing the introduction to Excel class, or demonstrated ability with Excel, at the discretion of the instructor.

August 6 - Part III: Access the power&#34;Database managers&#34; might sound like the guys who tell you to clean out your email inbox. But they’re not. Relational databases allow you to make connections in data that would never be visible sifting through documents or talking to experts. With databases like Access you can master some of the huge datasets where the secrets of governments, companies and candidates are hidden. Participation requires completing the advanced Excel class, or demonstrated ability with Excel, at the discretion of the instructor. The Practical Experience and Knowledge of the Instructors were a Big Plus for me because it helped me Groom Myself for the Real World.

 About the Earth 2100 Conference
Our country&#39;s current “business as usual” approach – avoiding or disavowing issues related to the short and long term sustainability of a healthy standard of living – has dire consequences for our younger generations. Around the world, ideas are being generated as to the cause of our planet&#39;s current issues and how we can deal with them now. We consider each of these ideas a “Plan B,” a concept that might bring Earth and all of us safely to 2100 and beyond. Unfortunately, a large portion of the public is not aware of these documents, particularly today&#39;s teens and young adults who will be addressing these issues as adults.
 
Our Task is embarking on a five-year series of inter-generational conferences exploring how Earth and its many communities can be brought safely to the year 2100 and beyond. The conference engages all interested participants in a conversation on the ideas of our biggest international institutions — The United Nations and World Bank, as well as corporations, spiritual institutions, educational institutions, think tanks, small businesses, and others. What are the real issues? What changes are needed? What is the role of today&#39;s younger generations? What action can they take and how do they get started?
 
The first conference, focused on the question “What’s the Plan?” will be held from 10:00 a.m. To 4:30 p.m. on Saturday, August 11, 2012, at the Arlington Central Library in Arlington, Virginia, USA.
 
Who Should Come?
Young adults. Parents. Educators. Governmental leaders. Spiritual leaders. Business leaders. Anyone who would like to become a global leader. Anyone concerned about young people and future generations.

If you plan to work on an existing project*, bring at least one co-founder with you to the event. If you have existing co-founders and none of them attend, you&#39;ll have to work on a new startup idea. But don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll still learn valuable skills that you can apply to your own business.

No co-founders? No problem. You&#39;ll meet many talented and smart people and have the opportunity to hear their new startup ideas. 
 

*An existing project is defined as one that already has mockups, prototypes or code associated with it. If that&#39;s the case, you cannot recruit others to join you. In the past, we have found that it is too difficult for participants to join a team that already possesses domain knowledge around an existing project.

 About The Speakers:
Lesley Perry, Scholarship Expert
Lesley Perry, Program Officer for Fellowships and Grants at the American Association of University Women (AAUW), manages programs offering funding to women pursuing graduate study and community projects promoting education and equality for women and girls. During her nine years at Northwestern University, she worked in graduate student services and received her MSEd in Higher Education Administration and Policy. 
Betty Paugh-Ortiz, Moderator
BettyPaugh Ortíz is President of BPO Consulting.  She provides expert advice on education, Latino relations, and nonprofit development.  Most recently Betty was the Senior Vice President at the NEA Foundation where she led the development and introduction of innovations to support the continued growth and mission.
I was working at the National Council of La Raza as Director of Maternal &amp; Child Health when I decided to go back to school. I was most worried about the finances, relocating to a new city, and leaving my job.  I was reluctant at first because I loved my job and DC.  But the timing was right and after researching programs opted for moving to Chicago to attend DePaul University. Today I have MA/MS in International Studies and Public Service Management. 
 
Holly Ann Triska, Panelist
Holly is the Director of Federal Programs at the Hispanic College Fund. She will pursue a Masters of Arts in Integral Economic Development Management at Catholic University of America this fall. 
After three years in the Peace Corps followed by five years at the Hispanic College Fund, I felt it was time for a new challenge.  I wanted to ensure my expertise met my evolving career interests: international women&#39;s rights and program evaluation.  Most of the last year was spent preparing for graduate school: studying for the GRE, saving, applying to scholarships, connecting with faculty, etc.  The hardest part for me was accepting change and uncertainty, but the alternative of not following my dreams wasn&#39;t an option.  I found a program that fit well with my interests, received two scholarships, and obtained a research position with my advisor working in Guatemala.  
 
Elida Sarmiento, Panelist
Elida is a Chief at Social Security Administration’s Office of Disability Adjudication and Review&#39;s Employee Services and Career Programs Branch.  She oversees nationwide employee training and professional development for one of the largest administrative adjudication systems in the world.
I started working for the Social Security Administration (SSA) after I graduated from high school. Though I developed an extensive résumé, I felt unsure about my career trajectory because I did not have a degree. Then, in 2008, I decided to continue working but move to Arizona and pursue a Bachelor’s degree. With a new job and increasing family responsibilities, it was challenging but I was determined to finish.  I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Organizational Management and Political Science and Government from Ashford University in October, 2011.  Now I have a new job in Washington, DC and am currently pursuing a Masters in Public Administration with an emphasis in Key Executive Leadership at American University.
 
Rosalia Miller, Panelist
Rosalia is the co-founder and Chairman of the Board of the Latino Student Fund. After a twenty-six years as an educator in one of DC’s top private schools, Rosalia retired from teaching, closed up her house, and she and her husband moved to Cambridge for a year.  Rosalia conferred a Master’s degree in Public Administration from Harvard University in May of this year.
I have always been a dreamer. I dream of what is possible for a young person. This is why I have put my heart and soul into building a strong foundation of education, encouragement and support for thousands of young children in my classroom and in the Latino Student Fund. After a twenty-year career at the IMF, and twenty-six years of teaching, I continue to dream of the possibilities. I dream that the Latino Student Fund will have a national presence and change the lives of many more deserving students throughout the country. When I decided to apply to the Harvard Kennedy School of Government for a Master’s in Public Administration, I had my doubts. Would I be able to do the work? My dreams were bigger than my fears and I just went for it. Now the dream for myself has come true, and I am ready to continue my life’s work.
 
Evelyn Garcia-Morales, Panelist
Evelyn is the Educational Enrichment Program Manager at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute (CHCI), an organization dedicated to developing the next generation of Latino Leaders. Her experience is deeply rooted in the advancement of all Latino’s through leadership program development, with organizations such as the National Hispana Leadership Institute (NHLI), and the Latinas Leading Tomorrow (LLT) organization. 
If the statement “nothing good ever came easy” is true, it explains why I choose to pursue a graduate degree. Before I became a full-time student at George Mason University’s, Master’s of Science in Organizational Development and Knowledge Management program (ODKM), I knew I would have to make reasonable, short term sacrifices-however, necessary to fulfill my long term professional and personal aspirations. Now, more than halfway through the program, I have reaped the benefits of post-secondary education with a new job, over $13,000 worth of scholarships for non-tuition expenses, and an additional set of skills I have applied in both my workplace and community. The source of my motivation to “juggle” the growing responsibility of a young family, my role as a full-time employee, and wife is in the satisfaction knowing I carved a road less traveled for others.
 
 Getting Off to a Great Start After College  
Our &#34;High Five&#34; Life Skills Retreat
with Matthew Morehead - Founder of Launch2Life
and Saxon Birdsong - BWFA
 
Benjamin Franklin once said, &#34;Life&#39;s tragedy is that we get old too soon, and wise too late.&#34;  
Baltimore-Washington Financial Advisors will sponsor a workshop to help young adults &#34;get wise&#34; much sooner.  The workshop will help them sharpen the critical life skills needed in the workplace - skills they haven&#39;t gotten from traditional high school and college curriculums.  
 
We recognize that it&#39;s an increasingly competitive and complex world, and that young adults are finding it difficult to navigate.  We all have a vested interest in helping our them get off to a great start.  That&#39;s why we are excited to announce the BWFA Life Skills Retreat.
  
It&#39;s going to be a fun day and very interactive.  Attendees will leave with at least 5 powerful tools they can start using immediately.   Whether your college age child or grandchild is already thriving or is merely surviving, we&#39;re confident they will benefit from the Launch2Life workshop.

Matt Morehead founded Launch2Life in 2008 after having spent much of the last decade helping affluent families achieve their financial career and life goals as President of a nationally recognized wealth advisory firm.  In his role as a trusted advisor to affluent families, he recognized the growing need to better equip the twenty-something children of his clients with the life skills they need to get off to a great start as independent adults after college.  He founded Launch2Life to do just that, creating a one-of-a-kind, &#34;bootcamp-like&#34; program focused exclusively on filling in the &#34;life skill gaps&#34; left by traditional college curriculums.  Many of his teachings come out of his own success as a young twenty-something.
After having spent 5 successful years as an officer in the U.S. Coast Guard, Matt quickly became the President of a wealth advisory firm managing over $200 million at the ripe old age of 31, and was named to Denver&#39;s prestigious &#34;40 Rising Business Stars Under the Age of 40&#34; shortly thereafter.  Matt graduated from the United States Coast Guard Academy with honors, earned his Certified Employee Benefit Specialist (CEBS) designation from the Wharton School of Business, and his law degree from the University of Connecticut School of Law.  When he is not obsessing about developing young twenty-somethings, he likes to play golf and cook, neither of which he does very well.
 




 
Saxon Birdsong started a fee-only Financial Planning practice in Ellicott City in 1990, and is now one of three principals in Baltimore-Washington Financial Advisors, Inc., responsible for managing the firm and its investment activities.

OMB Requirements for IPv6 Integration
In September of 2010, the United States Federal CIO released a statement that, “The Federal government is committed to the operational deployment and use of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).” and required all agencies to:
 · Upgrade public/external facing servers and services (e.g. web, email, DNS, ISP services, etc) to operationally use native IPv6 by the end of FY 20121;
· Upgrade internal client applications that communicate with public Internet servers and supporting enterprise networks to operationally use native IPv6 by the end of FY 2014;  
· Ensure agency procurements of networked IT comply with FAR requirements for use of the USGv6 Profile and Test Program for the completeness and quality of their IPv6 capabilities. 
 Yet, as of July 8, 2012 only a small percentage of agencies have complied, with one of the most common  reason given for not being ready is a lack of knowledge. 
Join our IPv6 industry experts for this one day IPv6 techtorial where the OMB requirements will be outlined in greater detail, we’ll discuss IPv6 and its impact to common IT infrastructure, and look at methods for meeting the 2012 &amp; 2014 requirements.

If you need to cancel at any point, please contact Vanesah Noechel at vnoechel@pdr-usa.net, so others may come in your place. Despite all the investment in cyber security, organizations still struggle to meaningfully improve their cyber security postures. This is due to three obstacles plaguing organizations today…
 
Over-reliance on Inherently Handicapped Signature-based Tools
Technologies, such as anti-virus, IDS/IPS and DLP, don’t catch anything unless you’ve told them to look for it. They fail consistently in this new era of advanced persistent threats and exploits, such as Flame and Stuxnet.
 
Juggling Disparate Products
Once an incident is detected, there are usually several products used to analyze the compromise. This hinders root cause analysis, creates too much room for error, and doesn’t allow for comprehensive remediation or proactive detection of the unknown.
 
Lack of Collaboration
Large organizations have multiple teams, each focusing on one piece of the cyber security puzzle—computer forensics, network security, compliance, malware analysis and more. Manually correlating each team’s findings in the event of an incident is inefficient and greatly increases the time to recovery.
CIRT 2 Overcomes These Obstacles…
AccessData’s Cyber Intelligence &amp; Response Technology (CIRT) is the first product to deliver analysis of data in motion, data at rest and volatile data within a single interface. Integrating AccessData’s network forensics, computer forensics, large-scale data auditing and malware analysis technologies, CIRT lets you see all critical data through a single pane of glass. And unlike other products, it actually provides enterprise-class remediation capabilities. So not only are you able to figure out what’s happening on your network faster, you’re actually able to do something about it faster.
Don’t miss this opportunity to see this industry-first solution in action.
Introduction to Federal Contracting (FDBDO)

 You think you know what you’re doing with your iPhone camera? Trust us. You have no idea. 
As a professional photographer, it’s liberating to put the big camera down and go out into the field traveling light. Enter: iPhone. With its powerful optics and limitless possibilities, it’s the perfect on-the-go creative tool. Our problem: Most people think they’ve got it figured out. But they’re wrong. There’s way more to iPhoneography than an Instagram filter and a vignette. iPhoneography has the complexity of photography, just in a new form. Let us show you how to get the most out of your apps, and we promise, we’ll blow your mind when you unlock the creative power in your pocket. 
 With the rapidly growing number of photography apps, SCOUT will help you pick the very best suite to set you up, and then it’s out to the field – no rules, just play – as we explore DC on 3G. Don’t forget to charge your batteries!

Frequently Asked Questions
 
Do I need to be there all day? What if I have to leave early or come in later? We certainly want each of our registrants to get the full benefit of the day. However, we understand that as women we have to often &#34;juggle&#34; our lives. We ask that you take this one day to really focus on you and attempt to make provisions to spend as much time at the conference as possible. There are absolutely no &#34;rules&#34; about how long you stay, when you come or when you leave. We do ask that you let us know if you will NOT be attending a meal function, The COSHAR Foundation is a nonprofit organization that directs several national, state and local initiatives around the country and we try to remain fiscally conservative. Further a portion of the proceeds will be directed to fighting breast cancer and domestic violence, therefore we prefer not to order food or items that will not be utilized.
 
 What is a Master Class? A Master class is smaller than the general session and deals with a specific area. For instance, our celebrity makeup artist may cover in her master class the &#34;how to&#39;s&#34; of finding a foundation, using concealer or getting that just right &#34;smoky eye.&#34; This is a session which allows for demonstration and question and answer. It is shorter in duration than the general sessions. Master classes will be conducted by physicians, dermatologists, makeup artists, personal trainers, hair stylists and nutritionists.
 
What is an Intimate Session? An intimate session is a smaller group session with an expert. This is perfect for questions, demonstrations and on the spot answers. For instance, a dermatologist can speak with you directly about your skincare issues. She can also quickly evaluate your skin and advise you as to what you need to discuss with your private physician.
 
What are the General Sessions? These sessions are held in the main ballroom, unless otherwise notified, and are topics that the hosts want to make sure everyone hears. These sessions will involve most if not all of the expert fields represented and will be engaging, fun and so very informative. Breakfast and Lunch will also be general sessions and the 3 Head to Toe Makeover winners will be revealed during this general session.
 
What is the Authors&#39; Salon? We are inviting several nationally recognized authors to this event . There will be a designated area for you to meet/greet them and to get your books autographed.
 
What is the DIVA Photo Shoot? The photo shoot is part of the DIVA package and is a &#34;mini&#34; shoot with a fabulous photographer. Registrants will get a quick makeup touch up if desired and then step in front of the camera. The photos will be either emailed or sent to you on a CD. All of the winners of the &#34;Head to Toe&#34; makeover will receive a photo shoot.
 
Can I submit questions in advance for the conference? We are happy to take your questions via email at info@beautifulwomaninsideandout.com. The moderators will select questions and poise them to the experts during several of the sessions. However, we will also make sure that registrants have time to ask &#34;live&#34; questions during each aspect of the conference. Further, even AFTER this conference is over, you will be able to still ask questions via our website and/or phone. We do advise that we give general information but that you should always consult your personal professional.
 
Can you tell me again about the registration levels? How do they differ?
 
It doesn&#39;t matter which level of registration that you choose, we can assure you that you will be empowered, educated and pampered! Space is limited on all levels of registration, but especially the DIVA level. We have designed this program in a way that caters to women&#39;s need for information in all of our topic areas. All meals, snacks and beverages are included as well as a registration bag that is filled with goodies! Please refer to the registration page and or our website for all of the details on the specific levels, and group discounts-- but here&#39;s a quick glance:
  
SALON: This is our general registration category.  
COUTURE: This is our upgraded registration category.  
DIVA: The name says it all, this is our highest registration level. 
 

  
I am a little confused on the general raffles and giveaways versus &#34;The Vault&#34;, what&#39;s the difference?
 
Let&#39;s be clear, the most important items that you will receive at this event is information, time with leading experts from across the country in all the areas of focus, a great exchange with other progressive women and time to take a &#34;pause&#34; in life and appreciate yourself. That being said the registration bags, gifts and &#34;extras&#34; are really just icing on the case. We will have several giveaways, some of which are raffle style and others are at the discretion of our hosts and moderators. You never know what will happen! The general gifts are simply fabulous and include gift baskets, gift cards, fragrances, books, art work and numerous other items. However, there is another level which we have termed &#34;The Vault&#34; and these are luxury items that are worth in some cases several hundred to thousands of dollars (we&#39;ve given away Ipads, wraps with fur trim, limited edition prints, framed pictures, limited edition sculptures, luxury vacations and more.
  
Every registrant will receive at least one &#34;key&#34; to the vault and with the progressive registration levels; you receive more &#34;keys&#34;. However, there is also the opportunity to buy additional &#34;keys&#34; to increase your chance of winning. This is a good time to remind everyone that a portion of the proceeds from this event will be donated to fight breast cancer and domestic violence.
  
Take a peak at some of our current and previous giveaways and Vault Items:
 
http://carldenpublishing.com/beautifulwoman/pages/about-bwio/the-vault.php
  
Are we going to have &#34;healthy&#34; food or is it really gonna be good? The food will be wonderful and we throw out the calorie counter (look at our previous menus in our programs)! We believe in balance and that food should look good and taste good! This is your day to be pampered and celebrated. We will teach you balance but trust us, these meals have been handpicked, tasted and the very best. The lunch is definitely a high end gourmet meal that will leave you fully satisfied and will be topped off by a decadent dessert. There will be beverage/snacks throughout the day. Please indicate on your registration form any food allergies.
 
Who are the vendors? Can my company be a vendor? The great part about this conference is that we appeal to a variety of different types of businesses. Literally, any business that desires to touch the lives of women should be interested in partnering with us. We have sponsors, patrons and vendors. Specifically, the vendors are a select group companies who must apply and be in with the theme of our conference. These booths may be informative, demonstrative, one on one with experts, educational booths; others are vendors with items that you may wish to purchase. They represent various aspects of the conference (health/wellness, medical, beauty, fashion, retail and a host of other companies). We have requested that they be engaging and provide you with a quality experience even in the booth. Additionally, you should stop by to see what &#34;extras&#34; they have waiting on you. All vendors must complete an application and you will be notified of the status within 72 hours. There are opportunities for advertising in our program and on our website, as well as other opportunities including items for the gift bags, door prizes and luxury items. Email: sponsors@beautifulwomaninsideandout.com  
Is this like a health fair? Absolutely not! We do lots of health fairs and events throughout the year and are experts in this area. However, we have intentionally NOT formulated this program like your traditional health fair because this is not our focus. Of course, we are going to talk about health but from a holistic view and with an eye on inner health (i.e. beauty of those arteries, that heart, that thyroid , your mental health, and how that affects outer health) and outer beauty (i.e. what not to wear, tips on how to maximize your looks, the options on weight management , antiaging options, obtaining healthy hair, options for getting the perfect eyelashes and more). We have planned fashion shows, entertainment, upscale location, meals that are FAB and an atmosphere of celebration!

The NIH offers two grant mechanisms to support the early stages of project development: the R03 (Small Research Grant) and the R21 (Exploratory Developmental Research Grant).  These two mechanisms, both of which support up to 2 years of research, are often useful as a stepping stone to an R01.  The basic difference between these mechanisms is that while the R03 supports small research projects that can be carried out in a short period of time with limited resources, the R21 supports exploratory, novel studies that are high risk, but which promise high reward.  This new workshop focuses on how to write each of these grant mechanisms.

DC Metro LSAT Prep will be hosting a FREE LSAT event on Saturday, August 25. Come for a practice test from 1:00 p.m. to 4:20 p.m., followed by an interactive review session and Q &amp; A from 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.

Ask anything you wish about LSAT prep, test day, or law school admissions in general.
The practice exam will include the 5 multiple-choice sections of the LSAT. As on the real LSAT, an &#34;experimental&#34; section (which does not count toward your score) will be given as one of these 5 sections, but the unscored writing section will not be part of this administration.
This event is limited to 15 participants. 
DC Metro LSAT Prep exclusively provides one-on-one tutoring for LSAT candidates. There will be no sales pitch or marketing attempt at this event. Students interested in discussing one-on-one tutoring may do so, but it is certainly not required.

 Market Fresh Cocktails 
A Hands-on Class that Changes Every Month with Seasonal Produce and Rotating Instructors
            
Photos: Jonathan Fong    Check out our Facebook page for my photos of classes.

2 hrs – This class teaches the culinary aspects of utilizing fresh seasonal ingredients in the creation and presentation of exceptional cocktails. It takes into account the most current information from our farmers as to what is ripe NOW, what is on its way out of season and what we have coming up soon. By staying in contact with our farmers markets and the seasonality of ingredients, we can continually keep our cocktails fresh and appropriate for the times.
We will include a brief review of tools and techniques, but the focus will be on the drinks and concepts. A basic knowledge of bar skills would be helpful but not required (this is a good follow up class for those who have taken our Mixology 101 class).  
Class takes place on the LAST THURSDAY of every month, from7pm to 9pm, and will be taught by different instructors each month, from top bars in San Francisco. 
Class starts on time. Please don&#39;t be late.

About Dr. Ritter&#39;s  book:
A Californian&#39;s Guide to the Trees Among Us features more than 150 of California&#39;s most commonly grown trees. Whether native or cultivated, these are the trees that offer shade, muffle noise, create wildlife habitats, mitigate pollution, conserve energy, and make urban living healthier and more peaceful. Used as a field guide or read with pleasure for the liveliness of the prose, this book allows readers to learn the stories behind the trees that shade our parks, grace our yards, and line our streets. More information on the book can be found here. 
Biography of Dr. Matt Ritter: 
Matt Ritter studies cultivated trees and trees that escape cultivation. He has a bachelor’s degree in microbiology and a Ph.D. in plant developmental biology. He is currently a botany professor in the Biological Sciences Department at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, and director of the plant conservatory there. He has authored numerous scientific papers about plants and contributed to many botanical references. A Kenan Fellow at the National Tropical Botanical Gardens, Matt is also the Ray Collett Visiting Scholar at the UC Santa Cruz arboretum, teaches for the Organization of Tropical Studies in Costa Rica, sits on the Board of CalReleaf and is chair of the City of San Luis Obispo Tree Committee.
Praise for Matt Ritter&#39;s new book:
&#34;Matt Ritter&#39;s fascination with trees shines through in this wonderful book. Accurate and thorough but also very readable and well-illustrated, this is an excellent identification guide and at the same time a celebration of the trees that grow in California&#39;s cities and towns. Anyone who is curious about trees is sure to find education and inspiration in these pages.&#34;
—David Sibley, author Sibley Guide to Trees and Sibley Guide to Birds
 
&#34;Ritter&#39;s work is great motivation for those of us who are intellectually adventurous within the playground that Mother Nature has given us. At last, a great reference to California&#39;s most commonly introduced landscape trees.&#34;—Tom Elias, author of Trees of North America&#34;A refreshing new reference with enough authoritative details, including up-to-date taxonomy and reflective graphics coupled with good cultural interest comments, suggests that this is a &#39;first grab&#39; reference for both students and environmental masters alike.&#34;—David Dockter, environmental planner and arborist, City of Palo Alto and Director of the Western Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture

                                                                                 Become a better photographer and stop using your camera&#39;s &#34;Auto&#34; mode in 1 evening.

Have you ever wondered why after spending hundreds of dollars on the latest cameras you still can&#39;t get photos you&#39;re really proud of? We&#39;re not talking about the party snapshots you post on Facebook, but stunning landscapes that can be considered fine art and grab attention for longer than 5 seconds.
Learn to capture beautiful photos and never miss a memory again.
This 3 hour class is a crash course in digital photography. Taught in our San Francisco studio (in groups of 20-25 students), you&#39;ll learn what all those knobs and dials on your DSLR do, the settings to use in any lighting condition, and even what kind of camera to buy if you don&#39;t already have one. You&#39;ll understand concepts like exposure, aperture, depth of field and shutter speed, and probably never want to use the &#34;automatic mode&#34; again.
No prior experience or camera equipment is necessary to attend. Just a desire to improve your photography skills. Take this class for yourself or gift it to a friend who&#39;s got a photographic itch to scratch.
Frequently Asked Questions


What&#39;s the class schedule? This is a 3 hour class held most Saturdays and Sundays from 10am-1pm or 3pm-6pm, and some weeknights from 7pm-10pm. The dates are scheduled approximately 1 month in advance, and more dates are added every few weeks.


What&#39;s the format of this class? It&#39;s a group class held in an indoor classroom setting in groups of 20-25 students.


I already have some photography experience from high school, or just from playing with my camera. Will this class be useful for me? Yes, it could be a good refresher for you to consolidate all the bits and pieces of knowledge you&#39;ve picked up over the years. You&#39;ll also find plenty of inspiration (in the form of some beautiful photos) to get back into photography if you haven&#39;t done it in a while. You get to ask any burning questions to a professional photographer. And it&#39;s a great way to spend an afternoon in the company of other beginners and amateurs. However, if you already have a good handle on things like shutter speed, aperture, ISO and manual mode, this class is probably going to be too basic for you.


What kind of camera do I need to attend this class? Bring whichever camera you currently own. No need to buy anything special or fancy for this class. We explain the differences between simple point &amp; shoot cameras and DSLRs, so you&#39;ll be better informed about what kind of camera to buy, should you decide to upgrade your current one.


What else should I bring to class? Anything you need to take notes on (pen, paper, iPad, laptop etc) and a snack or drink.


Have more questions? Please shoot us an email for a quick response (faster than calling, leaving a voicemail and waiting to hear back).

Ryan Waliany, Mobile Game Entrepreneur
Thursday, August 2nd from 6:30 pm to 8:00 pm.
Are you an (aspiring) entrepreneur or a non-technical employee looking for a stronger fluency in technical and programming-speak? Are you looking for a taste of what &#34;programming&#34; actually is, but don&#39;t know where to begin? This class will give you a foundation in the computing and Internet principles needed to engage with web developers. We&#39;ll ground &#34;programming&#34; into something less abstract by exploring fundamental concepts such as:

What is the Internet and how does it work?
Where is a website stored and how does it “run”?
What is the difference between Memcache and MySQL?
Which programming languages are used when?

We&#39;ll also get you started with tools you may not even know you have on your computer; examine the different layers of the Internet; and help you set up your first website on Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud. After leaving this class, you will understand important components of the Internet and have a basic understanding of how to wire those components together.
This class is intended for beginners, but students should bring their computers and be prepared to get hands-on experience with coding.
Ryan Waliany is a serial entrepreneur and works with his fiancée on indie mobile games. In 2010, he co-founded an Internet marketing/media company that generated over $6 million in revenues. Before that, he created a popular mobile game called “Word Seek,” which has had over 16 million games played and currently has over 20,000 daily active users.

What is ASQ-3tm? 
The Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) is a parent-completed questionnaire that screens children’s development ages 1 month to 5 ½ years old.  Screening young children is an effective, efficient way for programs to catch developmental concerns and start referrals/services when it does the most good. The ASQ gives parents useful information about their child’s strengths and needs and also gives them an opportunity to talk about any concerns or questions they may have about their child’s development. 
 
Why Use the ASQ-3tm?
Research tells us that early care and education have a long-lasting impact on how children develop. During a child’s first three years, it is important to focus on a child’s developmental needs and take advantage of a child’s natural ability to learn. By helping families identify their children’s strengths and potential delays, you play an important role in making sure a child has the very best opportunities to learn and grow. Because parents are partners in the ASQ screening process, it is a great way to bond with their children and to learn more about child development.
 
How is the ASQ-3tm different from the DRDP or other assessments?
Parent participation is at the heart of the ASQ. ASQ-3 relies on parents to observe their child and to complete the simple questionnaires about their child&#39;s abilities. Having parents complete the developmental questionnaires is not only cost effective but also enhances the accuracy of screening by tapping into parents’ in-depth knowledge about their children. When providers review the ASQ screening results with parents, it serves as a great starting point for providers to share their observations and build partnerships with parents.
 
Who should attend the training?
Family child care providers and centers, Family Resource Center staff, and Preschool For All  sites who care for young children from 1 month to 5 years old and want to know more about the importance of developmental screening and how to administer the ASQ-3.

What will I learn?  
You will learn about the importance and value of developmental screening, how to give and score the ASQ-3tm, to identify strategies to involve families in the screening, and how to include the ASQ-3tm  as part of the services you provide.

Intro to SQL: Learning from your Database 
Wednesday, August 1st from 6:30 - 8:00 pm
Alex Dempsey, VP of Operations, Peanut Labs
 
Imagine the things you could learn about your business if you could have a conversation with your database. SQL, the world&#39;s most popular database querying language, allows you to do just that. In this hands-on workshop, each student will get their computer set up with the free tools they&#39;ll need to talk to a database, learn the basics of the SQL language, and work through a data investigation of a fictitious web startup.
At the end of this class, students will know how to:
- Create a simple database and explore a complex one 
- Read and write queries using the SQL syntax 
- Summarize data with groups and functions
- Execute multiple types of the notorious table join
- Fix SQL bugs and find helpful resources
- Use SQL to solve real business problems

Pre-requisites and software requirements: This class is for beginners of all ages; anyone with genuine curiosity can learn SQL. Students must bring a laptop (or well-equipped tablet) to class. Instructions will be made available online to guide the installation of all of the required software on Mac, Windows, or (for the brave) iPad.
Alex Dempsey is Vice President of Operations at Peanut Labs, a micro-payments provider tracking hundreds of millions of transactions in a MySQL database. The middle child of a long line of teachers, he believes lifelong education and entrepreneurship are critical pursuits in the 21st century. He lives and works in San Francisco.

INSTRUCTOR NAMECoding Dojo que será realizado no iMasters SP.
A pizza já tá garantida pra galera!! :)
 
Segundo o http://codingdojo.org/: “Um Coding Dojo é um encontro onde um grupo de programadores se reúne para trabalhar em conjunto em um desafio de programação. Eles estão lá para se divertir, e, através de uma metodologia pragmática, melhorar suas habilidades de programação e de trabalho em grupo.”
 
O Coding Dojo tem algumas regras básicas:
 
Desenvolvimento guiado por testes: Antes de fazer qualquer implementação, deve ser escrito um teste, que ao passar indica que a implementação está correta.
“Passos de bebê”: Se um teste não está passando, você deve escrever o código mais simples possível que faça o teste passar. Quando for escrever um novo teste para o mesmo método, escreva um teste que teste só um pouquinho a mais da funcionalidade desejada.
Pair programming: A programação é feita em duplas. Cada dupla tem um piloto e um co-piloto. Ambos pensam em como passar no teste atual, mas só o piloto digita. Cada par tem por volta de 5 a 10 minutos no seu turno. Quando esse tempo acaba:
O piloto volta para a platéia
O co-piloto assume o lugar do piloto
Um novo co-piloto vem da platéia
Todos devem entender: O piloto e o co-piloto devem sempre explicar em voz alta o que estão tentando fazer para solucionar o problema. Qualquer um na platéia pode pedir explicações se não entender algum raciocínio.
Três fases: Um Coding Dojo sempre está em alguma dessas 3 fases, dependendo do estado dos testes:
Vermelha: Pelo menos um teste não está passando. A dupla da vez deve se concentrar em fazer o teste passar. A platéia não deve falar nessa fase, para não atrapalhar piloto e co-piloto.
Verde: Os testes acabaram de ser rodados e todos estão passando. Essa é a hora de quem está na platéia dar sugestões para melhorar o código.
Cinza: O código foi modificado de acordo com as sugestões, mas a bateria de testes ainda não foi rodada. Deve-se evitar fazer grandes modificações no código nessa fase.

We use our naturally fermenting starter, and explain its role in the delicious flavor of the crust. Throughout the process, we will learn about how to control the development of the dough, so that we can create a pizza in the exact likeness that we desire.

OVERVIEW
The US Government provides billions in grants, loans, tax incentives and more to keep R&amp;D here in the States. The funds are distributed through a variety of agencies such as NSF, ARPA-E, DOE, DOD, NIST, and SBIR programs; leveraging the government as a funder and/or partner can be a powerful competitive advantage and a way to circumvent the traditional venture financing process.  However, for many resource constrained start-ups it can be a massive diversion and not worth the time and effort required to be successful. In this workshop you will learn about formulating a strategy when working with government at the local, state and federal level, how to identify and evaluate resources available when applying for grants, and an overview of the grant-making process including best practices that will increase probability for success. Our workshops are candid, interactive and informal.  We want you to walk away with the real story behind how things work so you can make it happen yourself. 
TOPICS
•Do you really want to work with the government
•Who are the different agencies
•What kind of opportunities are out there (DOD Rapid Innovation Fund and others)
•How to evaluate opportunities effectively
•What are the different grant types
•Why do grant proposals fail
•How can you increase your odds
•Why partner with corporations and universities 
•How to find a good grant writer

Are you a seasoned performer or is the stage foreign territory? Do you like to make stuff up or do you get nervous at parties? Do you sing in the shower or do you want to loosen up?Regardless of your experience, background or training, we think EVERYBODY can benefit from studying improv. This six-session class is a fun intro to the joys and thrills of improvisation and the BATS Improv style.Students learn improv vocabulary, use practical skills, and perform in a friendly atmosphere. Foundation I is all about unleashing your innate skill. You&#39;ll play games and experiment with creating characters and scenes.Key concepts in Foundation 1 include:    * Spontaneity    * Making Offers (blocking and accepting)    * Storytelling/Narrative    * Status    * Endowments    * Where/Space Objects (creating &#34;props&#34; and &#34;locations&#34; out of thin air)Some of the lessons of this six-week course: Have fun. Accept the audience&#39;s ideas. Make your partner look good. Start positive. Pay attention. Fail &#34;good naturedly.&#34; Make eye contact. Avoid asking questions in scenes. Mime as well as you can. &#34;Yes, and...&#34; Dare to be dull. Accept your own ideas. Explore flexible status.In short, there&#39;s plenty to cover. And you&#39;ll be amazed at how the lessons apply to your life both on and off stage. Like we said, there&#39;s no experience necessary.At the conclusion, everyone &#34;passes&#34; and can move on to Foundation 2, but you can also take Foundation 1 as many times as you would like and are sure to get something new out of it each time.(For some folks, this all the improv they could ever want or need!)

Understanding Your Users: Intro to Usability Research and UX  
Thursday, August 9th from 6:30 - 8:00 pm
Anna Pereira, PhD Candidate, UC Berkeley
There’s more to your users than meets the eye. Usability research can help you better understand what you already know about your users while filling in the blanks of what you don’t. This class will provide a general introduction to usability research and some of the basic methods used to execute it, including survey design, usability testing/interviewing, and data interpretation. We’ll examine how these methods capture the mental models, problems, methods, and goals of users, and how that information can shape a product, influence design, and enhance the user experience.

 


Prerequisites: This is a basic level course created for students with minimal experience in usability research.

Required course materials: None.

Anna Pereira, MS, is a mechanical engineer pursuing her PhD in design and ergonomics at the University of California, Berkeley.

 D.Talks is an ongoing series of panel discussions presenting practical information about current trends and hot topics in the world of design and business. Our goal is to foster robust dialog and critical thinking, so crowd participation is an integral part of each event.
Many designers find it difficult to talk about money, often assuming that their work should speak for itself. But like it or not, businesses and decision makers attach a value to creative work that can affect the entire design process, including the final solution.
Join AIGA SF as we discuss how the ability to articulate the value of design to clients and non-designers elevates any design team from order takers to strategic partners. Topics will include:

Discussing how you can articulate the value of design
Measuring the ROI of design
Setting design fees
Including clients in the design process
Giving persuasive presentations
Becoming a strategic partner

Networking: 6:30 PM Discussion: 7:00 PM

Duration: 2 days
Cost: Free (RSVP cost is refunded upon attendance)
Location: UC Berkeley - Andersen Auditorium
Audience: this event is open to all undergraduate and graduate students from all universities, colleges, and high schools from San Francisco and neighboring regions.
Details: this 2-day event is designed to help students break into the field of investment banking. The workshop will teach students how to build a resume for investment banking and will train them for the technical and behavioral portions of investment banking interviews. During the workshop we will continuously assess the participants and will invite a select few to the Leaders Candidate Program, allowing them to become a part of the global network of graduates from the Leaders initiative. The program helps candidates with mentoring, networking, and career opportunities. Therefore, it is recommended that students who are passionate about a career in finance participate in this event and try their best to involve themselves in class discussions. Please note, students who do not attend the complete 2-day workshop will not be considered for the Leaders Candidate Program.
Schedule: the timeline of the event along with the details of each workshop are as follows:

Day 1.A: Sept 29 | 9:00 am - 11:00 am | Resume Workshop | Details: this workshop teaches the candidates how to create a resume that not only looks professional, but will help you in making the most of a single sheet of paper. We will teach the class the Leaders resume format and work through various content examples that can be included in the resume. The format taught here can be used for any profession or any other situation where a resume is required.
Day 1.B: Sept 29 | 11:00 am - 2:00 pm | Behavioral Workshop | Details: this workshop teaches students how to properly answer questions such as why investment banking. The workshop covers important topics such as explaining your “story” and how to properly answer questions related to both educational and professional experience. Nine out of ten candidates in investment banking interviews fail the behavioral component and that is the difference between getting an offer and getting a rejection email. 
Day 1.C: Sept 29 | 2:00 pm - 3:00 pm | Networking Workshop | Details: this workshop teaches students how to form, develop, and build relationships within the investment banking industry. Included in this topic are strategies to build your contact list, reach out to alumni, and create new connections. From there, the workshop covers recruiting events, informational sessions, and seminars,  examining techniques to use these opportunities to stand out from the rest of the student body. Remember, it&#39;s not what you know, but who you know.
Day 2.A: Sept 30 | 9:00 am - 12:00 pm | Technical Workshop - Accounting | Details: this workshop teaches students the basic and advanced concepts required for acing the technical portion of investment banking interviews. The accounting section of the technical workshop will cover financial statement analysis, changes and effects of major line items, and general questions that are asked in the majority of interviews. The mastery of this section is mandatory for passing first-round and final-round interviews.
Day 2.B: Sept 30 | 12:00 pm - 3:00 pm | Technical Workshop - Valuation | Details: this advanced workshop teaches students the various types of valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows, comparable companies analysis and precedent transaction analysis. This workshop covers the valuation topic in far greater detail and is an especially unique resource for candidates by conducting valuation examples that mimic real-world investment banking deals.

There are shows on the Bayfront stage each night to give students an outside perspective on the skills they&#39;re learning during the day. 
Set against the backdrop of the San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge right out the window, BATS&#39; beautiful Bayfront Theater is the venue for four days of playing, laughing, meeting new people, and discovering new, playful parts of yourself.  Past students have described it as summer camp for adults!
Snacks will be provided throughout the day to keep you going strong and opportunities to socialize with your fellow students will be organized for each evening after class!

This presentation will balance the notion that the planet&#39;s biological systems are collapsing due to human practices with the many green economy ventures that are sprouting up from the grassroots.  &#34;Social enterprise activists are creating a triple-bottom-line enterprise model that synergizes social justice, environmental restoration, and profitability, creating enterprises that make better profits healing nature than destroying it.  Given that world population will top out at around 9 billion, we need to accelerate the transition to sustainability or face the collapse of civilization as we know it.&#34;
 
Roundtable Questions:
What ways are you trying to reduce your resource footprint? (Americans are 5% of the world&#39;s population, consuming 25% of the world&#39;s resources)
The three main sectors--government, non-profits, enterprise--tend to be in silos and not cross-fertilize with each other. How can we strengthen the &#34;4th Sector&#34;--the place where the sustainability people in each of the three main sectors come together in collaborative networks?
&#34;If you start using the word GOD as a verb instead of a noun, how does that affect your day-to-day treatment of other living things.?&#34; (Unpack the word &#34;others&#34; in the Golden rule to mean all species.)The editors of Saveur Magazine have tested these recipes in their kitchen and have partnered with ITK Culinary to present this class on French Country Classics.

Sunday, August 26th from 12:00 - 4:00 pm
Chris Castiglione, Digital Product Developer
The Programming for Non-Programmers Series:
Are you a creative or entrepreneur that wishes you could speak tech with your web development team? Maybe you wish you could code a bit yourself? Programming for Non-Programmers is workshop series at General Assembly designed to help non-programmers communicate more efficiently with developers. Because leading a development team (without being a developer yourself) can sometimes feels like “talking about dancing”, we’ve created an interactive and friendly environment in which to learn the basics. 
If you&#39;re running a tech start-up, it&#39;s essential that you familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of web development. Ultimately knowing how to &#34;talk to the talk&#34; will help you communicate better with developers, and overall just look really cool. Come with questions, and a desire to have fun!
Part 1: Fundamentals
In this workshop we&#39;ll tackle some development principles to get you on the right path. We&#39;ll look at questions like, &#34;Front-end vs. Back-end?&#34;, &#34;Is UX necessary for my project?&#34;, &#34;What is this Javascript function thingy, and why am I passing it strange math equations to it?&#34;.
We&#39;ll spend about half of the class looking at actual code and writing some basic Javascript, HTML &amp; CSS ourselves.
We&#39;ll learn the following:

What coding languages should I use for my next project?

Schedule: 1 sessionClass size: 10 students maximumClass length: 3 hours totalPrerequisite: Completed or concurrent Studio Scenework course (IMPORTANT: Click here before registering)
 
** Back by popular demand!  For just one day! **
 
This course will focus on beginning, middle, and, that always elusive ending of scenes with Kimberly MacLean.  We will look at how to utilize your unique senseof humor in finding the button of a scene. Enhance your listening, recall, and truthful comedy skills to work withothers in making and accepting offers to end a scene.  Explore how to start and maintain a grounded scene that comes to a natural conclusion.  If you were in Kimberly&#39;s previous The End class, you can expect to see a repeat of the concepts and exercises.  Practice makes perfect!  Come play again!
 
In Kimberly&#39;s words:
&#34;You know that awkward moment when it seems like you should be at the end of a scene, but somehow find yourselves circling the landing over and over, unable to end. The scene goes on and on until a horn is honked, an arm is feverishly waved, or the lights just tentatively fade down. When we started discussing my teaching of a class, my fellow improvisers and instructors started pointing to my knack for ending scenes with a button that is comical while it gently and logically ended the scene. By looking at the story arc and your own style of improv lets spread the gift of ending scenes at their conclusion (and we&#39;ll talk a little Scooby Doo while we&#39;re at it. Seriously.)&#34;

Jennifer M. Granholm was elected governor of Michigan 2002. In 2006, she was re-elected with the largest number of votes ever cast for governor in Michigan.  As Governor, Granholm led the state through a brutal economic downturn that resulted from a meltdown in the automotive and manufacturing sectors. She worked relentlessly to diversify the state’s economy, strengthen its auto industry, preserve the manufacturing sector, and add new, emerging sectors, such as clean energy, to Michigan’s economic portfolio.
 
From the caucuses to the campaign trails to Capitol Hill, “The War Room with Jennifer Granholm” is shedding light on the Election 2012 news of the day and featuring in-studio commentary by political insiders, campaign veterans, opinion leaders and newsmakers whose unique perspective will inform and inspire. Granholm, an outspoken and passionate political leader, was the first woman elected governor in Michigan. During two terms as governor, she pioneered the state through an economic storm, strengthening its auto industry, preserving the manufacturing sector and adding new, emerging sectors, such as clean energy.
“The War Room” is taking viewers inside key election races and providing in-depth coverage of what is actually happening on the campaign trail. Each night, Granholm presents a dynamic, fun and informative show that actively engages viewers with a blend of smart analysis and relevant commentary from guests on the cutting edge of politics, business and entertainment.

The Studio class can be taken multiple times. Students who take the Studio scene work class can also take the Specialty Studio classes with focus on character, status, playwrights, genre, stage skills, acting, etc. These specialty classes will help the student move from the Studio level to the Graduate performance level.

Coaching Agile Teams course description
Coaching Agile Teams is a training experience that covers both the being and the doing of agile coaching.  There’s a lot to learn, experience and practice! At the end of the course, you will be capable of applying many new tools and techniques, as well as your own mindset changes, to coach agile teams to high performance. As practical as it is provocative, the Coaching Agile Teams course challenges agile coaches to rise to the fullest expression of their role and offer simple, practical ways to get there.
Outcome
You’ll walk away from the course with your personal coaching improvement backlog – a tangible plan you can use to thoughtfully improve your coaching when you’re back in your daily circumstances.  We use your real world situations and scenarios throughout the class allowing you to craft powerful ways to address the challenges you face.  You’ll also have many new things to try with your teams and you will probably depart with a few provocative ideas to chew on (in fact, maybe wrangle with for a while). All of these outcomes add up to your ability to become the excellent agile coach your teams need.
AudienceThe Coaching Agile Teams course is meant for ScrumMasters, agile coaches and project managers in transition – people  who are ready to take the next step beyond practices and principles and move into activating teams to achieve the full promise of agile.
This course is tailor-made for you if:

You’ve had a few experiences as an agile coach and it just doesn’t seem to be working for you.
Your job has become routine and you notice the teams seem to be going through the motions, too.
Your teams get the practices and are doing well, but not getting the fabulous results you were supposed to get.
Your are an awesome agile coach and you want the skills that will help you earn the Certified Scrum Coach designation.
You are spread across many agile teams because your managers think agile coaching is not a full-time job.
You are not sure if the agile coach role is really right for you.

Course Content

PrerequisitesYou must be a practicing agile coach with at least 6 months of hands-on experience. Ideally, you will also have Certified ScrumMaster or equivalent agile training.  This is not an Introduction-level course and we will not be covering the basics of agile or Scrum.  In addition, you will be asked to use what you know about your real teams throughout the class so that you can leave with ideas for helping them as soon as you get back.

Our Instructors
Lyssa Adkins
Since 2004, I have taught Scrum to hundreds of students, coached many agile teams, and served as master coach to many apprentice coaches. In both one-on-one settings and small groups, I enjoy a front-row seat as remarkable agile coaches emerge and go on to entice the very best from the teams they coach. Prior to agile, I had more than fifteen years of expertise leading project teams and groups of project managers (I was even a PMO Director -- twice!), yet nothing prepared me for the power of agile done simply and well.
I believe that agile is more than an alternate project management methodology and I am passionate about deepening the roles in agile – specifically agile coach and agile manager – to help agile move into its fullest expression.
I hold an alphabet soup of certifications: Certified Scrum Coach (CSC), Certified Scrum Trainer (CST), Project Management Professional (PMP), Six Sigma Green Belt (SSGB) and I am also a trained Co-Active Coach and Leader.
In 2010, I authored Coaching Agile Teams: A Companion for ScrumMasters, Agile Coaches, and Project Managers in Transition.
 
Michael K. Spayd
In a word, my professional work is about transformation.  I seem to be wired to help people, and systems, change. I am drawn to cutting edge &#39;technologies&#39; for coaching and organization development.  I have been an organizational change coach and consultant for 20 years, working with Fortune 500,   small businesses and non-profits. For 10 years I have specialized in technology-oriented teams and associated enterprise transformation efforts, working with over 50 teams in that time. I was trained as a Team and Organizational Coach and hold a Masters degree in psychology,  and I am trained in Co-Active leadership, executive coaching, and organizational behavior.  I am also a Certified Organization and Relationship Systems Coach (ORSCC), a Certified Professional Facilitator (CPF), and a Certified Scrum Master (CSM).

Join two of BATS’ world-class coaches for an in-depth dive into the wonders of BATS-style improvisation! This three-day intensive is perfect for students with little to no improv experience who want to get a thorough introduction in an immersive, multi-day workshop setting.
The structure of this workshop (6 hours of study per day, for 3 days straight) allows students to steep themselves in the principles of BATS style improv—spontaneity, listening, storytelling, playfulness, accepting offers, paying attention, creating environments, and making something out of nothing.
Set against the backdrop of the San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge right out the window, BATS&#39; beautiful Bayfront Theater is the venue for four days of playing, laughing, meeting new people, and discovering new, playful parts of yourself.  For those of you with some background in improv, these three days will provide a great opportunity to learn some new improv activities, exrcises and games in the BATS style of play.

Attendance at the first session of your course is encouraged - if you think you have to miss the first session of your Foundation 1 class, please notify the office
Are you a seasoned performer or is the stage foreign territory? Do you like to make stuff up or do you get nervous at parties? Do you sing in the shower or do you want to loosen up?Regardless of your experience, background or training, we think EVERYBODY can benefit from studying improv. This six-session class is a fun intro to the joys and thrills of improvisation and the BATS Improv style.Students learn improv vocabulary, use practical skills, and perform in a friendly atmosphere. Foundation I is all about unleashing your innate skill. You&#39;ll play games and experiment with creating characters and scenes.Key concepts in Foundation 1 include:    * Spontaneity    * Making Offers (blocking and accepting)    * Storytelling/Narrative    * Status    * Endowments    * Where/Space Objects (creating &#34;props&#34; and &#34;locations&#34; out of thin air)Some of the lessons of this six-week course: Have fun. Accept the audience&#39;s ideas. Make your partner look good. Start positive. Pay attention. Fail &#34;good naturedly.&#34; Make eye contact. Avoid asking questions in scenes. Mime as well as you can. &#34;Yes, and...&#34; Dare to be dull. Accept your own ideas. Explore flexible status.In short, there&#39;s plenty to cover. And you&#39;ll be amazed at how the lessons apply to your life both on and off stage. Like we said, there&#39;s no experience necessary.At the conclusion, everyone &#34;passes&#34; and can move on to Foundation 2, but you can also take Foundation 1 as many times as you would like and are sure to get something new out of it each time.(For some folks, this all the improv they could ever want or need!)
 
**wondering why this class is a bit more expensive than our SF offerings? 
When we give classes outside of our SF home, it costs us a bit more to do it given space rental and travel time for our coaches, who are all based up in the SF area.  So we need to cover our slightly increased costs.  Thanks for understanding!

30 minute toddler class taught during fall. ages 3 to 7 
 About Michelle Lenehan: 
After graduating from U.C. Berkeley, Michelle began her career as property manager for a large real estate firm in San Francisco. She grew into an escrow assistant position and then entered wholesale lending where she worked as an account executive for National City. Michelle spent the next 13 years in the title industry becoming a leading sales representative for Fidelity National Title, earning acclaim as a top producing sales representative and affiliate of the year for her local realtor association. With a passion to understand and teach real estate related issues to others, Michelle’s role with the company suits her perfectly. Michelle has become integral to ForeclosureRadar in teaching agents, investors and homeowners to understand the foreclosure market and to create the best opportunities for themselves.
About ForeclosureRadar: 
The mission at ForeclosureRadar is simple: To bring transparency, efficiency and honesty to the foreclosure marketplace. The foreclosure process has been shrouded in darkness for too long. Get-rich-quick gurus and disreputable list peddlers have thrived in this darkness, manipulating consumers and real estate professionals alike. People who needed help were hard pressed to get it.ForeclosureRadar is ending this.
Achieving this mission starts with credible, up-to-date data. ForeclosureRadar is the only place to get reliable information on properties in every phase of the foreclosure process. This includes preforeclosure (when a homeowner is given a notice that they are in default), auction (when the lender takes bids on foreclosed property in a public forum), and REO (or real estate owned, where the lender takes ownership of a property that fails to sell at auction).Consumers, investors and real estate professionals no longer have to scrape together scattered information to make informed decisions.
ForeclosureRadar has also created a free online community, ForeclosureTruth.com, where participants in the foreclosure market can interact more efficiently. Consumers find Realtors specializing in foreclosures; Investors source service providers; Lenders connect with brokers to move properties more efficiently. It&#39;s all there, out in the open.
But underneath the data, beyond the Website, lies our real difference: An unflinching commitment to speaking the truth about the foreclosure marketplace. Foreclosure is an unpleasant process. There are human beings behind the numbers. Those who want to get rich quick should seek other venues. It&#39;s time to clear the air of hype. Creating a foreclosure market that works better for everyone requires nothing less.
 
Please note that online registration for this event will be open until 12:00 (noon) on August 2. After this time registration will only be available at the door and the price will increase to $30 - payable only by cash or check.

 Windows 8 Convert-A-Thons
Turn your Windows Phone Application into a Windows 8 Application
This event is specifically tailored for developers who have Windows Phone applications or ideas. The transition from Phone to Windows 8 is the easiest path out there. So, come convert your app into a Windows 8 Metro application in a day. That&#39;s right. We’ll be there to help migrate layout, update logic, and show you differences and changes in Release Preview. Bring your Windows Phone app and leave with an app headed for the Windows 8 store. The Windows 8’s store is the largest opportunity for developers, ever. Leverage the work you have already done to get your place in line. What do I mean? I mean that during this beta period, the only access developers have to the Store is through tokens that we hand out. It’s a nomination and approval process, but don’t let that freak you out. We don’t need finished applications; we need applications that look like they will be finished. If your idea is good and your execution is excellent, you are in.

Negotiating for Women:
Knowing What You Want...and Asking For It!
August 28, 2012, 6:00 - 8:00pm 
Gap Inc., San Francisco
 

Have you ever been so thrilled to be offered a job that you didn’t negotiate the salary?
Has a peer been promoted ahead of you, even though their work was inferior?
Are you a great negotiator when advocating on behalf of someone else, yet not for yourself?
Have you ever worked really hard and exceeded expectations at work and then waited for a raise that never came? 

If you answered yes to any of these questions, you’re not alone!  Believe it or not, even some of the most successful, high-powered women are uncomfortable with negotiating for themselves and go to great lengths to avoid it.  And we’re not just talking about negotiating our salaries, a raise, or a promotion.  As women, we miss opportunities to negotiate all the time, in every area of life!
Research has shown that women negotiate four times less often than men and tend to concede much sooner and accept less.  In fact, approximately 20 percent of women don’t negotiate at all.  That’s crazy to imagine, right?  The good news is that it’s never too late to learn how to negotiate like a pro. Now is the time to take control and finally get everything you deserve!
When you join this interactive workshop, you’ll discover mindblowing information that will change your views on negotiating, give you the tools and confidence to negotiate like never before, and reduce the discomfort and anxiety associated with it.  It will prompt you to reconsider everything you’ve ever learned about negotiating and look at it through a whole new lens.  
In this workshop, you will learn:

4 biggest reasons women avoid negotiating
Why negotiating like a man doesn’t work
How the double standard affects women in negotiations
Tactics for evaluating your own worth and value
How to overcome fears of negotiating and ask for much much more
Strategies for flexing your negotiation style
Identifying tons of opportunities for negotiation

After this workshop, you will be negotiating for success within two weeks time and on the road to negotiating more often and with increased confidence.  You will be seizing opportunities to ask for and get more in every area of your life and getting results!
Who should attend this workshop?

Women who believe in investing in themselves because they are worth it
Women who are not afraid to admit they need some help with their negotiating skills
Someone who recognizes that it’s never too late to become an awesome negotiator
Women who are tired of avoiding the negotiation process out of discomfort or fear
Women who know they deserve more but realize they’re going to have to ask for it
Ambitious, intelligent women who also like to have fun

申請大學及獎學金的一般迷思
一對一個別諮詢
(866) FAFSA-22 x101

我的收入和資產都很低, 所以我沒有其它的選擇, 只能負擔孩子上社區大學。
我知道我符合申請獎助金的資格, 但是很奇怪, 我孩子的學校沒有核發不用償還的助學金給我們, 只有須償還的學生貸款, 而且利息不低。我那裡做錯了嗎?
我們夫妻倆很努力工作, 也為孩子們和自己存了教育基金和退休金。但我們所存的錢只能負擔他們上UC的學校, 私立學校就負擔太大了。
我的收入與資產偏高, 但是我一個跟我情形差不多的朋友, 他的孩子還能拿到獎學金進入大學就讀, 這是怎麼一回事?

Thursday, August 2nd from 6:30 - 8:00 pm
Justin Williams, Senior Marketing Strategist, StrongMail

Pre-requisites: A basic knowledge of marketing concepts is recommended but not required. This class was designed with beginners in mind, but those with a more advanced understanding of marketing (specifically digital marketing) will also benefit from attending.

Overview
Over the past few years so we&#39;ve hosted a quite a number of classes where we&#39;ve trained our community with the skills to begin, continue, and finish their own projects. To no surprise, we&#39;ve had some incredibly talented students attend who have moved forward to create some pretty serious work. We&#39;ve been so impressed by some of the work that the students have made that we are providing a platform for our students to show and discuss their work. The Creative Technology Forum is an ongoing platform for our community to present their work. We will gather together every two months to update one another on our progress. We hope that the Forum will encourage and nurture unforeseen collaborations between like-minded individuals. We encourage you to join us and meet others in the community who are using code, microcontrollers, and emerging media to stylize their artwork. Some of the projects that will be presented at this forum include: Colin Thompson will be showcasing a Quartz Composer demo that uses GLSL shaders to explain in realtime the principles of a RenderMan DSO plugin developed for Disney Pixar&#39;s Brave and presented at ACM Siggraph 2012. 
Eric Socolofsky will be demoing a brief walkthrough of the Exploratorium&#39;s Bay Area Observatory project and some of the visualizations premiering on the Bay Area Model, as well as live demos. The Bay Area Observatory at the Exploratorium&#39;s new location, opening Spring 2013, will host a collection of exhibits and events investigating the built and natural landscape of the Bay Area. Within the Observatory will be the Bay Area Model, a platform for visualizations of data describing the Bay Area. A topographic model of the Bay measuring 5&#39; x 4&#39; will display a range of content, investigating physical systems such as fog and earthquakes and exploring human-made and social systems, from transportation to GPS mapping. 
TweetDreams is a multimedia musical performance made from live Twitter data. During a performance, tweets containing specific terms are retrieved from Twitter&#39;s servers, sonified into short melodies, and displayed graphically. The piece is created by three groups of users: the audience, the performers, and the world. The audience is invited to tweet during performances with a special &#34;local search term.&#34; Our software detects any tweets with this term and assigns visual and audial prominence to simple text-based entries. The performers drive the software and shape the piece by selecting search terms and controlling various musical and graphical parameters. The &#34;global search terms&#34; are used to bring in tweets from the rest of the world. During a performance, anyone tweeting anywhere in the world with one of these terms becomes a participant and generative resource for TweetDreams to work as a musical public interaction that is simultaneously local and global. TweetDreams was created by Luke Dahl, Jorge Herrera, and Carr Wilkerson at Stanford University&#39;s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA).

Decorative Art Tiles
 
Create stunning works of art! 
Artisans around the globe have been painting and glazing tiles for centuries, from the streets of Morocco to your kitchen floor. Come paint a tile of your own. We will supply all the materials you need.  Each tile will be an original work of art, you may hang on the wall, display on a table or give to a friend!To remain viable in the emerging “Creative Sustainable Economy,” organizations must continuously change, innovate, adapt and execute synergistically. How? By exploring insights into the organizational members&#39; collective, unconscious minds which are already trying to self-organize creatively. This practical and repeatable form of sensing reflects the philosophy of “Presencing.” In today’s world, there are always some new adaptive success strategies trying to emerge in all living systems. Unfortunately, few look for them until there is trouble and chaos which tends to beckon more power than insight.  
The focus of this session will be on exploring, through case studies and experiential exercises, a creative self-organizing inquiry methodology that loosens identification with existing mental models and generates self-discovered collective insights into the co-evolution of strategy, culture, leadership and consciousness.
Self-discovered insights help both individuals and teams make shifts in mental models, behaviors and identity without lengthy discussions and unproductive conflict. Creative insights, in the form of images and symbols are narratives that have immediate psychological traction as illustrated in http://www.slgllc.com/SelfOrganizingInquirySunMicrosystems.pdf .They become fractal like “attractors” that organize the various means of the mind to their ends.
This session is for members of Bay Area organizations who want to learn more about creative, systemic evolution.
Attending this session will benefit you if:
You would like to explore a universal success strategy for all living systems.
You would like to discover a practical repeatable way of sensing what is already trying to emerge in the co-evolution of parts in a human system. 
You would like to discover what is currently self-organizing in your psychological system.  
You would like to better understand the creative process.
You would like to create a story to tell about what is emerging.

Easy Gluten Free/Vegan Pizza Made at Home
You have been asking for this one and now here it is. I have finally hit upon the perfect gluten free/vegan pizza crust. This recipe is so easy. You will be able to have hot fresh pizza even after a long day of work. This is a batter that you simply pour into your pizza pans and leave to rise in a warm place. You can make multiple pizzas and then par-bake them and freeze them for later use. This tastes so much better than anything else that you can currently buy.
I have also been exploring options for making your pizza without cheese. I will also teach my recipes for caramelized onion spread and a cashew &#34;cheese&#34;. Believe me you won&#39;t miss the cheese. You will get all recipes and I will take you through step by step by instruction. And the best part, I am going to cook the pizza right in front of you and we will taste them fresh out of the oven. I will also show you how to make foccacia bread from the same recipe.
Students are encouraged to bring their cameras and notebooks and document the process. Class size will be limited to 10. 
For more information, please contact me at larsendesigns@gmail.com.

Instructor:  Sharon Minsuk

She recently returned, working for over two years at Silicon Valley internet startup Kachingle, where she continually dared to venture into territory she knew nothing about, working on the JavaScript front end, the MySQL database, and the PHP in between. Somewhere along the way Kachingle needed a browser extension, and Sharon said &#34;I can do that!&#34; and proceeded to get one working on multiple browsers. And so can you!

RoyalCastleInvestments@Yahoo.comPathway Tools Advanced Tutorial:
August 1st - 3rd, 2012

SRI&#39;s Bioinformatics Research Group will be holding a Pathway Tools Tutorial August 1st - 3rd, 2012, at SRI International in Menlo Park, California.

Introduction
This tutorial is for people who are already familiar with the basic features of the Pathway Tools software. The goal of the tutorial is to teach scientists how to use the advanced features of Pathway Tools such as Web Services, Comparative Analysis, Programming API/Queries, SAQP, Advanced Groups usage, Administering a Pathway Tools based website, Administering a MySQL server for Pathway Tools and Advanced curation topics.
 
Tutorial Schedule

Day 1: TBD
Day 2: TBD
Day 3: TBD

Topics and scheduling are subject to change.
Tutorial Details
Each day&#39;s tutorial will last from 9:15 AM to 5:30 PM. Each day will combine lectures with lab sessions in which students apply the software to a PGDB. Programming experience is helpful but not required.
Four example PGDBs are:

EcoCyc http://www.EcoCyc.org/
HumanCyc http://www.HumanCyc.org/
Yeast pathway database: http://pathway.yeastgenome.org/biocyc/
Arabidopsis pathway database: http://www.arabidopsis.org/biocyc/index.jsp

Registration
Please see above for the registration types and fees. This registration fee is non-refundable.
Early registration rates are available for those who register before June 25th, 2012.
Online registration means one or more attendees will participate in the tutorial remotely.  Attendees will be able to see the presentations via WebEx and will hear the presenter via a call-in number. The call-in number will not be toll-free. Questions may be asked via the WebEx chat interface or via the teleconference, but the ability of SRI staff to answer complex questions during the lab sessions for online attendees will be very limited. Online registration attendees will be sent the login information in advance of the tutorial.

Computers and Software
We recommend that you execute a Pathway Tools license agreement before you attend the tutorial, which can be done online at [Pathway Tools License].
We will provide 64-bit Linux computers for participants, but we recommend that attendees use their own computer with Pathway Tools already installed for use at the tutorial. Participants can either use a 64-bit Linux laptop, or can use one of our computers to connect to a server at the participant&#39;s home institution. This enables the user to leave with not only knowledge of how to use Pathway Tools, but with a working installation on their own computer.
If you plan on working with your own computer (either in the form of a laptop or a server), it is mandatory that you install Pathway Tools and verify that it is working in advance of the beginning of the tutorial. Please see the Pathway Tools Installation Guide for more information.
 
Readings
We suggest that you read the following before the tutorial:

Pathway Tools User&#39;s Guide Chapters 1-3, 6.1-6.5, 7. This document is present in the Pathway Tools software distribution in directory aic-export/pathway-tools/ptools/VERSION/doc/manuals/


&#34;Pathway Tools version 13.0: integrated software for pathway/genome informatics and systems biology&#34;
&#34;The MetaCyc Database&#34;

We also have webinars on various aspects of using the Pathway Tools software.
Travel
Google Map: SRI, International 333 Ravenswood Ave., Menlo Park, CA 94025
For those of you travelling from out of town, please be advised that SRI is located approximately 20 miles from both San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and San Jose International Airport (SJC), and is approximately 30 miles from Oakland International Airport (OAK). SRI is about 30 minutes south of SFO by car on highway 101.
The SRI web site contains directions to SRI, other nearby hotels, and driving directions to SRI. Please see [SRI Directions].
By Car
SRI International is at 333 Ravenswood Ave in Menlo Park, between Middlefield Rd and El Camino. 101 exit: Willow Road.
By Shuttle
You can take Super Shuttle from the airport to save money over a taxi cab, but they will probably make a few stops along the way.
By Transit
You can also take the Caltrain commuter train line. Take BART or a taxi from SFO or OAK airports to the Millbrae Caltrain station. Then take Caltrain south to the Menlo Park stop. There is also a free shuttle that takes passengers from SJC airport to the Santa Clara Caltrain station. Caltrain has week-day rush-hour express trains and runs every hour otherwise. Caltrain schedules are subject to change. Please see the Caltrain website for up-to-date schedules.
Lodging
We suggest you try these two hotels first so that most people end up staying at the same hotels: Menlo Park Inn, Red Cottage Inn.
 
Arriving at SRI
Note: There are two entrances to SRI on Ravenswood Ave. Please use the western entrance, closer to Laurel Avenue than to Middlefield Road, for parking your car. The sign by this entrance says, at the bottom, &#34;Building-E Visitors&#34;. Please take a look at the SRI campus map below, and park your cars in the parking lot next to Building E. After parking your car, you should proceed to the Building E Lobby.
When you arrive in the Building E entrance/lobby, call Wilma Lenz from the telephone in the lobby, at extension 4904. If she does not answer, ask the receptionist to reach Quang Ong and tell them you have arrived for the Pathway Tools tutorial hosted by Peter Karp&#39;s group.
[Map of the Menlo Park area]  [Map of the SRI campus]About Home Ec Cooking Classes
I learned how to cook by watching the cooks in the Chez Panisse kitchen, by carefully tasting and training my palate, and eventually by apprenticing and working in that kitchen.  That experience blew my mind open, and after several months in the kitchen I started to recognize patterns and rules common to every dish, no matter what the ingredients or particular methods of preparation.  I eventually came to realize that with a careful understanding of how to apply four basic elements, I could make anything taste delicious.  Over the past eleven years, everything I&#39;ve continued to learn in the kitchen has essentially been a refinement of my understanding of the application of salt, acid, fat and heat.  As a teacher of both professional and home cooks, it&#39;s my ultimate goal to give people the tools to become intuitive cooks and free them from the reigns of cookbooks, recipes, and measuring implements by helping them refine their palates, sensitivity in the kitchen, and understanding of basic kitchen science.  The most important lessons I share with my students are those that impart a fundamental understanding of universal tenets. I&#39;d like to invite you into the kitchen with me for this unique, empowering series of classes.  You&#39;re welcome to take as many or few as you like, but the series is designed as an immersion and elements of each class will interplay with the others to help give students a comprehensive understanding of cooking.In each class, I will describe and demonstrate for each element its roles and functions, basic science, and effects on taste in a dish.  We&#39;ll taste and discuss thoughtfully in an effort to give our palates a bit of contextual understanding.  And of course, because I believe so strongly in the power of experience (and muscle memory) you&#39;ll get a chance to put your new skills to use as we all cook a lovely meal together with the concepts of the day in mind.  In the evening, we&#39;ll retire to a table set in the back garden, eat our dinner, drink some wine, and I&#39;ll answer any further questions that may have arisen while we cooked.  You&#39;ll leave empowered and inspired to return to the kitchen, ready to practice your skills, refine your knowledge, and looking at food with a whole new perspective.  
Take a look at this sweet 90-second video shot by the folks at the San Francisco Chronicle at a Home Ec class held at 18 Reasons in 2012 to get an idea of how things work:
 
About &#34;Heat&#34;
A handful of variables determine whether high heat or low, dry heat or wet, a covered pan or lidless, is best suited for a particular dish.  Once you learn how to identify and approach these variables, decisions about what to cook, and how, at the farmer&#39;s market, butcher block, and in the kitchen will be a lot more straightforward and a lot less intimidating.  In this class you&#39;ll learn a basic vocabulary of kitchen terminology and a streamlined way of thinking about heat and cooking methods.  
Home Ec: Understanding Heat will cover the following: 
- Conquering your fear of high heat- How to decide which dishes should be cooked over high heat, and which should be cooked over low heat- Hot and fast versus low and slow- Understanding the role of steam in cooking- Understanding different cuts of meat and how they should be cooked- Understanding sugars and starches in ingredients and how that dictates how to cook something- Defining and simplifying cooking terminology: sauté, fry, braise, roast, toast, bake.Together, we&#39;ll prepare a variety of dishes for dinner using different cooking techniques to demonstrate the principles of heat.
About Samin
A professional cook and freelance writer, Samin Nosrat looks to tradition, culture and history for inspiration. Trained in the Chez Panisse kitchen, she cooked there for several years before moving to Italy, where she worked closely with the Tuscan butcher Dario Cecchini and chef Benedetta Vitali for nearly two years. She spent five years as the sous chef and &#34;farmwife&#34; at Eccolo restaurant, butchering, brining, and preserving nearly everything in an effort to make the restaurant as self-sustaining as possible. 
Her work has been featured in the New York Times, Vogue, Wallpaper, NPR, and San Francisco Magazine, while her own writing has appeared in Martha Stewart Living, Yoga Journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, Meatpaper, Edible San Francisco, as well as on her blog, Ciao Samin. 

What Students Say About Home Ec and Samin
&#34;These classes will change the way you think in the kitchen.  I&#39;ve taken a lot of cooking classes over the years and stopped because I wasn&#39;t learning anything new.  I signed up for Samin&#39;s series because she&#39;s such a pleasure to be around and I was hoping to learn.  Learn I did!  The concepts she taught were simple and completely understandable.  The way fat, acid, and salt work together and counterbalance each other was fascinating.  The food we prepared was designed to demonstrate the concepts so that we could understand and remember.  There were several a-ha! moments.  It was worth every minute and every penny.&#34;&#34;Samin has an amazing knack for translating the inherent skills of a stellar restaurant chef to the everyday home cook.  While things like fat and acid might not sound all that sexy, you&#39;ll be amazed at how much better your cooking will be once you understand how they work.  If you have ever hoped to become more intuitive and less recipe-dependent in the kitchen, Samin&#39;s classes are perfect for you.&#34;&#34;Samin is more than a teacher, she is an inspiration. Her methodology goes way beyond recipes into how to think about cooking and even more importantly how to become a more visceral cook. The class I took with her has made me a much more confident and brazen cook!  Plus she is so much fun!&#34;

 Be our guest at these hour-long working sessions to engage in conversation with sustainability leaders from across sectors. Share your challenges and successes, learn about valuable tools and resources, and offer feedback on SSV&#39;s Sustainability Implementation Roadmap™. Light snacks and beverages will be provided. Class Time/Dates: 7–10pm on Thursdays, August 9, 16, 23, 30, September 6, 13 
Schedule: 6 sessions; once a week for six weeks Class size: 14 students maximum Class length: 3 hours (18 hours total) Prerequisite: Foundation 1 (IMPORTANT: Click here before registering)
This six-session workshop helps you refine your improv knowledge and focuses on performance skills. You use the tools you developed in Foundation 1 as you learn more games and explore your own style of play. 
While the emphasis is still on fun, course content also explores more conceptual and technical information and helps you build the skills you need to perform improvisational theatre in front of an audience. 
Over the six-week course, Foundation 2 introduces the following concepts: 

Teamwork 
Stage Skills 
Status 
CROWE (character, relationship, objective, where, emotion)
Narrative 
Scene work 

Games and excercises will show students how to: 

Follow and serve the narrative of the scene 
Project vocally 
Move with flexibility and comfort on stage
Use stage picture to enhance scenes 
Enrich your &#34;space object&#34; and &#34;where&#34;’ work
Develop professional theatre behavior 
Display flexibility when dealing with fellow players 
Play a variety of believable human characters
Support the context of the scene 
Explore styles and genres 
Say YES! 
Make your partner look good 
Be in the moment
Get yourself/your partner in trouble 
Take your time 
Keep your promises 
Move into the future 
Fail good naturedly 

Students in Foundation 2 are required to read one of the definitive texts on improv: IMPRO by Keith Johnstone. Johnstone invented Theatresports, the main improv format we play at BATS. BATS sells the book for $25; it is also available from a variety of retail outlets. When enrolling, please indicate whether or not you would like to purchase the book from BATS. If so, you can pay for it at time of registration and pick up their book on your first day of class.
At the conclusion, everyone &#34;passes&#34; and can move on to Foundation 3, but you can also take Foundation 2 as many times as you would like and can continue to work on your performance skills. (And since each session is different, it&#39;s likely that you&#39;ll get a whole new take on the experience from a new teacher and new classmates.)

Networking for Fun and Profit  Let&#39;s face it, giving speeches in public, writing articles, or doing anything else out of one&#39;s comfort zone, including networking, is not easy, comfortable and/or fun for many people. Just like anything else, knowledge is power, and practice makes perfect. Once you learn, practice and eventually master a few basic techniques, you will realize networking can be fun and even very profitable!
There is a certain &#39;art and science&#39; to networking. If you are a business owner or a salesperson, it is imperative to learn how to network effectively; your financial success may depend on it! You don&#39;t have to be a natural-born extrovert or even an expert in your field to be able to approach a stranger and make a connection!
We could learn much from children. Some children tend to be fearless; they simply do not know any better. They usually do not have any inhibitions or insecurities that prevent them from doing or saying things. As we get older, experiences, assumptions, and fears creep in and prevent us from accomplishing our goals.
Let&#39;s get back to the basics (clean slate) for a moment, and simply forget all you have learned or thought you knew about networking. Humans are social creatures by nature. At our workshop, you will practice how to socialize and network not only to grow our businesses, but to meet more people effectively and successfully!
Consider the following quotes (Please share this and pay it forward!):

Networking = Hospitality = Success
Best business is personal business. Give and you shall receive.
 Perception is reality. You only have one chance to make a first impression. 
 The key to success is not what you know, or who you know, it&#39;s who knows you! 
 A little courtesy goes a long way. Golden Rule - Treat others like you would like to be treated.
The main purpose of any business is to grow. If your business or organization is not growing, it it NOT a business, it is a hobby!

In this course, a continuation of a class that began last year, you&#39;ll work with Dave Dennison and a small, tight ensemble of advanced improvisors to explore two genres.  The class culminates of in two performances - one halfway through and another at the end of the series.
This advanced workshop will explore the rich world of genres-books, plays and movies with an improviser&#39;s eye.  Rather than skimming the tops of many genres, this class will delve more deeply into just a few. The students and instructor meet every other week to immerse in specific characters and locations and on the off week be asked to watch original source material in a given genre.  Performances will be in the genre(s) and formats of the classes&#39; choosing.
As this is a graduate level, ensemble-based workshop, priority is given to previous enrollees and additional applicants must obtain approval from the coach and dean in order to enroll.  Please email regina@improv.org to ascertain eligibility.

 The Roast Profiling and Cupping course is one of our most popular programs. This course is very suitable for beginning professionals or for more experienced roasters who want to expand their coffee horizon with new concepts about roasting practices and tasting protocols. The tasting exercises in this course are designed to provide you a very clear idea of the concepts of “acidity”, “mouthfeel” and “aftertaste”. The aroma exercises will put your olfactory abilities to the test. The course provides a solid introduction into roasting profiling, both from a theoretical as well as from a practical point of view. As with all our courses, we allow for sufficient one-one-one interaction with the lead-trainers.
Day 1: Introduction Into Sensory Evaluation and Tasting ExercisesThe course starts with a thorough introduction of concepts in sensory analysis, followed by a review of coffee tasting protocols and the use of different tasting forms. We’ll discuss cupping language with a review of coffee tasting vocabulary. Day 2: Continued Coffee Tasting and Applied Roasting TheoryThe first session in the morning will feature another series of triangulation exercises. We will train your ability to apply descriptive language for describing flavor attributes. Subsequently we will dive into roasting theory with an overview of core concepts about roasting mechanics, heat transfer and the interaction between the quality of green coffee and the roasting performance. An introduction into roast profiling will follow next. The afternoon session will include hands on roasting on the various roasting systems in our lab. Each machine has been setup to accomplish roasting profiles in with different concepts of controlling heat. Day 3: Putting It All TogetherWe generally start the third day with an extensive cupping session featuring various coffee products and/or blends. Ideally, we review the coffee products that were brought by participants. In this way you can obtain constructive feedback on the flavor profiles of your own coffees. 

Boot Coffee Purchase policy: PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLYAll sales are final. Course fees are not refundable. If you need to cancel, course fees can be applied to future courses or another person can take your place. For all changes, we will charge a change fee of 25% of the course price.

 Hack away at systemd, the journal, and integration with our favorite languages, daemons, and log utilities.
Some focus items may be:

Network support for the journal.
Performance profiling the journal.
Easy Type=notify service support for more languages.
Better socket activation support.
journal logging libraries for every major language. Python and PHPare deep into being kicked off. Java, Ruby, and node.js are next on mylist.
Once a language has journal support, build application-levelintegration. For example, Drupal&#39;s watchdog could go field-for-fieldinto journald. Jenkins could have a plugin for build andadministration logs. Twisted&#39;s log facility could send to journald.
Tools to automatically ship journal logs off to systems likeGraylog2 and Flume. This is possible now in thelowest-common-denominator of syslog, but we could be preservingfields.
Documentation and examples for the native journal APIs
Documented deployment strategies for recording append-only logs ofthe hash chains

今回は、絶滅危惧種となりつつある日本の半導体産業をとりあげ、生き残りの可能性について考えます。 
講演　：  「日本の半導体産業の現状と未来」
内容　：　１９８０年代に隆盛を極め、世界を席巻した日本の半導体産業はリストラと合併を繰り返し、事業縮小が続いています。DRAM大手のエルピーダの会社更生法適応も記憶に新しいところです。かつて世界市場を席巻した日本の半導体産業の勢いはありません。世界的に水平分業化への移行が進む中、日本の各社事業構造の転換が遅れています。半導体産業よりも早く水平分業化が進んで行ったPC業界など他の産業の歴史を分析し、今後の日本の半導体産業の進むべき道を考えます。このセミナーでは個々の会社に関する細かい分析はしません。5年単位で進むマクロな業界の変化を分析することで中長期的な業界変化を予測し、対処法を皆さんと一緒に考えます。

Pan Theater Classes:We focus on Improv Theater and trying to create strong characters in detailed situations. There is no need to be funny and no pressure to make people laugh. Humor may arise out of a scene or may not. Our approach is organic. The quality of the scenes is in character depth. Essentially, we focus on creating live theater minus the script. A well-done scene is one where no one would believe the work wasn&#39;t scripted. We&#39;ve been teaching, performing and practicing the way of improv since 2002. We know what we&#39;re doing. We&#39;ve taught members of the Screen Actors Guild (Northern California Chapter), members of Harvard&#39;s Immediate Gratification Players and local students, professionals, actors and improv curious.
 
Who takes classes at Pan?Professionals looking to improve their speaking skills, actors looking to deepen their ability to improvise for commercial and theater auditions, writers seeking to let go of judgment, teachers looking to learn theater games for use in class, people new to the area looking to have fun and make some new friends...... and many more. People that have done improv at other places looking for more, or improvisors new to the area looking for a performance home. People looking for an improv class that is close to BART. 
 
What do people do with their training?We have had students go on to audition for local theaters and for commercials, we have had students further their own personal performance goals such as character work and solo performances, we&#39;ve had students audition for both Pan and other improv and sketch groups. Many of the members of Pan&#39;s house teams, Awkward Face and the Afters, began their improv training with Improv Basics. 
 
Our students have formed their own sketch and improv groups or theater groups. We&#39;ve had students return to their work world with a greater sense of freedom, and willingness to risk. Pan Theater performers have gone on to study with the Groundlings, perform with Shanghai San Francisco, pursue MFA or MA degrees in theater and to seek local professional representation. Pan has been described as warm and comfy, and as &quot;Theater Bootcamp&quot;.
 
In short: 
&quot;Pan performers gain confidence in themselves and their work. They gain a willingness to take risks and make mistakes. A Pan performer will say yes, and try a new approach, style or way of doing things without resistance or letting fear overcome them. At Pan “yes, and” is a way of approaching life.&quot;
 
What past students say about our classes:
 
From Ian Campbell-Jones (Training Troupe Alumni)
David&#39;s teaching style is a precise and sublime guide into the practical and mystical sides of improvisational theater.
&quot;Taking classes and performing at Pan has served me in more ways than I can count. I feel physically fit, mentally strong, and highly aware of my moral instincts.&quot;
Ian 
 
From Betsy Aaron (Training Troupe Alumni)
David Alger&#39;s instruction and direction at Pan Theater is masterful. Having dabbled in improv in the past but not really getting it, I decided on a whim to try one more time with a class at Pan. David has a way of explaining improv and moving students and troupe members through the process that&#39;s metaphorical of life, showing how it&#39;s full of nuance and meaning. David makes learning improv a joy, and what I have learned has helped me far beyond the work I do in this performance art; I bring what I learn in my day to day life, and it has made my life brighter, more manageable and more fun. David creates a safe place to take risks and fail, to practice life, something we so rarely get to do. I&#39;m grateful for all David and Pan have taught me! 
Betsy Aaron 
 
From Conor Allen (Awkward Face Troupe Member and Training Troupe Alumni):
Pan Theater is an exciting place to both study and perform improv. Classes are infused with a dynamic spirit rooted in the fundamentals of relationship based scene work and improvisation. The emphasis at Pan is on the student, with ample opportunities to perform in shows and in monthly jams with other troupe members of all levels. From the beginning, students at Pan will feel like they are a vital part of an improv community that is as unique as the individuals who walk through its doors. Whether you are looking to gain a greater understanding of theater and improv in general, or a looking to be a part of a dynamic ensemble, Pan is the place to go. Conor
 
From Lauren Schaefer (guest performer- Awkward Face- Summer 2009)
While working at Pan I learned and got to experience what professionalism in improv looked like. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming and also really hardworking and focused. I learned as much at Pan in my short time there, than I learned in years of practice with other troupes. My time was well spent with Pan.
 
While at Pan I was able to highlight the skills I already possessed and improve them, as well as, find the skills I needed more work on and improve on those to become a balanced improviser. I also got to dabble in improv styles that I had never worked with before which was wonderful.
 
At Pan, I felt so comfortable and felt like I was able to experiment and stretch myself as a performer in ways I had not been able to before. After working at Pan I feel more comfortable performing in both Dramatic and Comedic Improvisational styles.
Thanks!!
Lauren Schaefer 
 
David Davidson Berkeley, CA age 33
Pan Theater is a Great Place to open your Wings, Learn to Fly and Craft your Improv Skills. I&#39;ve seen some world class performances here in the fleeting moments of &quot;rehearsal&quot; and in the tightly knit Awkward Faces performances. In rehearsal David&#39;s direction is relentlessly revealing. A performer is lucky to have such intense attention to detail, and surgical honesty from so serious a director, once... maybe twice... in one&#39;s life time. He is an Amazing Director with an eye for the subtleties of what is epic. He helps lead the Troupe into their finer moments with messages that will provide solace to listeners of stories who are all ages. The directors who accompany him are encouraging in their laughter and gentle direction! I will always value the lessons I have learned and continue to learn at Pan. 
Pan Theater has shown me things I would not have seen otherwise. Become a better performer AND a better person! Pan Theater is.... Fun! I knew I had found my Never land, and experienced my Home Coming... when Deitrich did head stands as we confessed our silliness and shared secrets over slices of watermelon! For a moment there each person was who they really are! And at Pan this kind of lightening strikes more than once! 
David Davidson Berkeley 
 
David&#39;s improv class is fabulous! He reviews the basics differently each day so we can continue to anchor them - I enjoy being able to practice more due to the uncrowded classes. Great for anyone wishing to enhance improv skills; I&#39;ll definitely be back for more - 
Rosalie Valerio,
Instructor, Western Career College
 
&quot;I loved the Basic Improv class with David. I felt comfortable and free to play, and have since discovered that I also got a very good foundation in improv. It has helped my acting immensely.&quot;
--Rebecca Northen
 
I thought David&#39;s improv class was amazing I had so much fun and I recommend it for any actor it helps a lot in the future. David is a fun and great teacher and the class is GREAT! 
A+ from Amy Roiland, Actor member of SAG (Screen Actors Guild)
Note: Amy is a working LA actor these days...
 
The Pan Theater Beginner Improv class was a lucky find for me. I had been away from theater altogether for about 18 years and was really itching to get back into it but was a bit scared of getting in over my head too fast. 
 
The Pan Theater was an emotionally safe place for me to get back into the swing of things - David is a great teacher who provides very insightful feedback that has really allowed me to at first brush-up on and ultimately improve my acting skills as well as providing an excellent launching pad into the world of improvisational theater. Thank you David and thank you Pan Theater!
Chris
 
Ralph Thomas (Improv Basics Graduate, Training Troupe Alumni, Awkward Face Member, Pan Coach)Taking Beginning Improv at Pan Theater was one of the most playful fun things I&#39;ve done in my adult life. David creates a wonderful safe learning environment that makes it easy to learn. I was always surprised when the time was up because the class went by so fast. 
I ask many of my coaching clients to take an Improv class because it helps them become more spontaneous, less judgmental and more open for personal growth.
Ralph Thomas, Personal Life Coach
 Who have we taught?
We have taught local actors, performers including members of the Northern California Screen Actors Guild (SAG), local companies and organizations, non-profits and those new to improv that were nervous and scared. We believe in Yes&#39; and as a way of life and art. We believe in humility, and hardwork.

And now you?

  " class="notranslateSo you&#39;ve already thought about attending networking events and you&#39;re up to it, but you just haven&#39;t felt like you have anything to offer or what to even say in conversation with people you meet.
 
What if someone asks, &#34;What do you do?&#34; How do you answer that in a more impactful and engaging way other than the typical &#39;I&#39;m a (fill in the blank)?&#39;
 
In other words, how do you make them lean in and then give them an opportunity to connect with you further if they wish?
 
This is what I call &#39;networking like you mean it&#39; and boy does it make networking worth your time and so much more fun!
 
I&#39;ve wasted hours of time leaving networking events pissed off because I didn&#39;t have clarity on what I was saying or doing at these events. Not to mention showing up at events that were not even remotely in alignment with what I&#39;m about.
 
But imagine knowing how to powerfully answer that inevitable &#39;what do you&#39;? question, people leaning in for more, and then leaving the event with appointments from people excited to learn more about how you can work with them!
 
Client Testimonial 
&#34;I WAS GETTING ready to start networking for the very first time and I didn&#39;t understand why I couldn&#39;t just introduce myself as a Wellness Coach. Everyone knows exactly what that is, right? Ha! Like a good student I listened to Naima and we began working on my compelling statement. The morning before my networking event Naima and I made some final tweaks and I really felt good about it. It gave me the confidence I needed for that night. That evening a lady turned to me and asked &#34;What do you do?&#34; I took a deep breath and confidently recited my compelling statement. As I was talking to this group of ladies they all stopped what they were doing, leaned in and were completely captivated by what I had to say! Wow! It worked so much better than I had imagined and definitely created more interest than if I had just said &#34;wellness coach&#34;. One of the women excitedly yelled as I was talking &#34;That sounds like me, I think I need to talk to you&#34;. And just like that, at my very first networking event I created a little buzz thanks to Naima!&#34; - Joanne Van Niekerk, Wellness Coach

This is why I&#39;m offering my event &#34;Network Like You Mean It&#34;- Fun Networking Training for Rookie Entrepreneurs with cocktails to follow!






Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll take away from this event:





How to capture the attention of ideal prospects (they lean in when you do this right)  
How to schedule a follow-up conversation with someone who expresses interest in you without you feeling pushy 
How to possess a powerful presence when you speak so people instantly feel like you know what you&#39;re talking about when you open your mouth (they&#39;re judging more than just your words) 
You will practice stating your powerful &#39;What do you do statement?&#39; among your peers (this is fun!)

 





*** BONUS  .  BONUS  .  BONUS  ***
 Each student will receive a 2-hour video training of me teaching my &#39;Cash Conversations - How to Convert Interested Prospects into Paying Clients&#39; (value: $65) 

These are the fundamentals of networking. It&#39;s not just about showing up, saying whatever you think in the moment, and hoping things work out. It&#39;s about being confident in what you&#39;re talking about, feeling good about it, the right people raising their hands to connect with you further, and you inviting them in for more.
 
This is what you will begin to master by attending this fun event.
 
Then reverse happy hour cocktails to follow at the lovely Lake Chalet @ Lake Merritt. Think ginger cosmo....yes baby! ;)

Achieve Your speaking and Leadership Goals Provision of therapy services in SNF continues to be under intense scrutiny from CMS, its Contractors and the Office of Inspector General (OIG). The confusing start to the implementation of the MDS 3.0 and RUG IV in 2010 has continued over into 2012.
The change in practice patterns in the 2011 fiscal year prompted a warning from the OIG and more changes by CMS to ensure that therapy services were being provided, not just appropriately based on the needs of the patient, but also being paid at the rate of actual treatment provided and not at the projected amount generated by the existing PPS assessment schedule.
Staff are struggling to understand the modification that were introduced with the MDS 3.0, not only in the Final Rule in July 2011 but ongoing in the training sessions provided after it was published contradicting some of the published regulations. These more recent changes are included in the updated RAI Manual effective April 1st 2012.
This course includes such topics as; MDS 3.0 Assessments; RUGS IV payments, Case Mix Index and Index Maximization; what CMS determines is “skilled” therapy along with different treatment modes; how to clearly support the medical necessity of therapy services through both nursing and therapy documentation, assuring proper reimbursement, and the appropriate use of Restorative Nursing services.
Case studies and exercises will provide the participant with a fuller understanding of the regulations and their impact on reimbursement. With this knowledge the licensed professional is empowered to make decisions to assure Medicare compliance, quality of care and maximize legal reimbursement.
Program Highlights
1. MDS 3.0 ASSESSMENTS; COT, SOT, &amp; EOT OMRAs and the rest, what the manual really says!
2. FACT vs. FICTION: Just how much do you REALLY KNOW about Medicare Part A?
3. RUGs IV: Determining appropriate RUG categories along with Index Maximization
4. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS: What you really need to make the reviewer happy.
5. DOCUMENTATION DIVIDE: How to get Nursing and Therapy on the same page
 
 
Download our brochure Mastering Medicare BrochureSusan Foley (The Office, My Name is Earl) brings her years of experience from Los Angeles and Chicago as a working actor to provide SF Bay Area actors/improvisors a real-world class on how to land commercials, and have fun doing it!
According to casting directors, there is a growing need for actors with strong commercial improvisation skills. In fact, many breakdowns read strong improv skills a must. Most commercial auditions don’t consist of reading large volumes of copy where the actor gets to show his or her great “acting” ability. Auditions consist of responding to prompts, exercises, and loose story ideas with confidence and spontaneity.  It takes your unique creativity.  It takes improvisation. Whether you are an actor in need of improv skills, or a seasoned improvisor craving on-camera experience - this class is for you!
 
- Exercise your on-camera improv muscles
- Practice typical commercial audition prompts
- Work with current real copy.
- Receive personalized feedback
- Gain comfort in front of the camera
- Learn the subliminal “no’s” most actors unconsciously present
- Walk away with tools to audition with confidence
- Bring your headshot/resume for personalized feedback.
 
Instructor’s Bio:
Susan Foley has had roles on The Office, My Name is Earl as well as Days of Our Lives and has appeared in numerous local and national commercials, industrials and trade shows. Commercial spots include Arby’s, Burger King, Well’s Fargo, Cox Cable, Purex, and Glade. She is a classically-trained, award-winning actress currently working in Los Angeles. She received her Master’s degree from Northwestern University and has also studied with the Patsy Roddenbergy of the Royal Shakespeare Company. A Second Ciity-Chicago alumnus and student of Del Close, Susan trod the improv stages of Chicago while teaching acting at Loyola University.

Fusion Partner Dance Weekend with Wren LaFeet

Partner Dance Intensive Workshop
 

Join Nomad Dance creator, Wren LaFeet, in learning this emerging dance phenomenon that engages a dancer&#39;s connection to themselves, their partner, music and the Earth. You&#39;ll develop connection and improvisation to play towards evolving a conversation in movement, rather than working within a basic step. Drawing from Blues, Swing, contact improvisation and other contemporary styles, the goal of this workshop is to learn how to speak in a common language, not what to say. Discover dance as a way to know each other on a level that transcends words. 
 
Come express yourself and be heard.


Workshop days will be divided up like so:


SATURDAY11:00am - 1:30pm: Connecting the DotsParticipants will learn the essentials of connecting with a partner and moving together in the absence of an established basic step.
1:30 - 2:30: LUNCH
2:30pm - 5pm: Partner-techture (or, How 2 Become 1) Having established a connection, how do we communicate ideas and listen to our partner? Many partner dances use specific steps to move through space. We&#39;ll explore a number of them of how they inter-relate and shift with different music. Then we&#39;ll throw them away and continue making up our own steps as we draw awareness to body and facial gesture as critical elements of our language.SUNDAY12:00pm - 2:30pm: Space and TimeMomentum, tension and compression and moving from the center are key elements in moving together through space. We begin to explore musicality, the maleability of time and the importance of stillness as it relates to balance and story telling of a song.
2:30 - 3:00: BREAK (bring a snack!)
3:00 - 5:30: Spinaesthesia (or, Talk Dance to Me, OR, Get Intuitive with It!)Spinaesthesia is the act of feeling and seeing sound and music as movement in the body. We&#39;ll look at solo movement inspired by our favorite music and how to &#34;speak&#34; the ideas found there in an open accepting partnership and respond through our connection by feeling the flow of conversation, rather than thinking it. 

Come in clothes you feel comfortable moving in. We&#39;ll be warming up at the beginning of each day, preparing you to move freely and intuitively from all of your energy centers. Socks or leather soled shoes are recommended.
Cost of workshop is on a sliding scale. If you are interested in taking the workshop, you may put down the $50 non-refundable deposit and pay the rest upon arrival at Twin Space. If you KNOW you&#39;re in, I ask that you pay what you are able to afford. 
Looking forward to dancing with you! Many blessings, and Thank You!

with Lucy Xiao, L.Ac. For more information please visit this event&#39;s listing at SFZC.org. Part of the magic of Burning Man is the altogether unexpected nature of what will happen. For one week, we step outside of our usual selves, finding God in a phone booth, discovering your true authentic self in the eyes of clown on whip-its, or stumbling upon the Barbie Death Camp and Wine Bistro. But, all this novelty can be a strain on your relationship. Once you combine it with the heat, dehydration, strange substances, strange food and even stranger campmates, your previously lovely and wonderful partner may seem to have turned into some sort of dusty alien. A dusty alien you can barely stand. Fortunately, you can avoid a visit to the Costco Soulmate Trading Outlet with a bit of preparation and foresight. In this workshop, led by open relationship coach and 5x Burning Man veteran Marcia Baczynski, you’ll find out everything you need for your relationship to not only survive, but thrive, at Burning Man. We’ll cover:

Your #1 secret weapon for avoiding fights on the playa (especially those really, really stupid ones)
The real reason the Burn makes or breaks relationships
What to do when you have different ideas of what “fun at Burning Man” means
A quick and easy way to get the most out of your time together -- and apart
Simple and practical steps you can take now to make your Burn together the best one ever

Plus, you’ll walk out with your own personalized guide for staying connected, getting what you both need and having  a blast during your time in the dust.

Note: Class size minimum of 8; maximum of 20Beanery? Yes, it&#39;s a real word - and a real place. The Beanery is where Hodo artisans produce our soymilk, tofu, and yuba - as well as all of our ready-to-eat dishes. Like a bakery and its bread or a charcuterie and its meats, The Beanery is dedicated to Hodo&#39;s expertise – soybeans.   Hodo opened the new Beanery in West Oakland in 2009. Our building was originally built in the 1920s as a candy factory and then became a bakery. Good mojo for Hodo, we believe. Between 2008 and 2009, we renovated the space to suit the particular needs of tofu making. To design and fabricate our equipment, we worked with one of the oldest remaining tofu equipment producers in Asia. We are particularly proud of the visitors’ room, where we welcome the public to view our production and sample many of Hodo&#39;s creations, fresh from Beanery. Tours are offered twice a month during production hours. 
Here is some important information about our tour - PLEASE READ:

Tours start promptly at 10:30. Please be sure to arrive on time, leaving time to find street parking.
We welcome you to take photos during the tour.

Overview
 
We&#39;ve seen many shifts in ways to control sound over the millenia; everything from animal skins and bones to hacked Game Boys and everywhere in between. We find ourselves positioned at an interesting point in time for how we manipulate sound in a post-instrument world. The topic of alternative musical interfaces has been discussed by those attempting to redefine how we&#39;ve shaped sound since the tribal era, but the discourse seems to be thriving. We&#39;ve brought together three specialists (see below) who have dedicated large portions of their lives to the noble task of constructing new musical interfaces and pushing musicians to interact with their instruments in new and different fashions.
 
The object of this evening is to gather together those interested in redefining our physical relationship to sounds and music. If you are interested in audio we recommend that you come join in the discussion with us.

The Amazon Elastic MapReduce 3-Day Developer Course gives you the essential skills to develop applications on Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR). Our goal is to make you productive as quickly as possible, while setting the stage for your future growth as an EMR developer.
This course gives you the essential grounding in the principles of Hadoop and the MapReduce computation model, the basis of EMR, the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for distributed file storage, the roles of other essential tools, and how to write applications effectively using these tools. If your team is new to EMR, you’ll learn the skills necessary to transition your existing data management applications over to EMR quickly and then start leveraging the new capabilities EMR gives you for data analysis.
Prerequisites
The following prerequisites ensure that you will gain the maximum benefit from the course.

Programming experience: This is a developers course. We will write Java, Hive, and Pig applications. Prior Java experience is strongly recommended.
Linux shell experience: Basic Linux shell (bash) commands will be used extensively. Some prior experience is recommended.
Experience with SQL databases: SQL experience is helpful for learning Hive and Pig, but not essential.

 Optional Reading for the Course 
   Exploring Scrum: The Fundamentals  (People, Product, and Practices) by Dan Rawsthorne and Doug Shimp  . Dan Rawsthorne and Doug Shimp have trained and coached thousands of people, most of them whom are already using Scrum, their most common complaint is that they need help to do it right.  And many (if not most) of them need some help.  
This book is for them and others like them.
This book is not an introductory text. Dan and Doug assume that those who read this book know, or think they know, something about Scrum. This book takes a deep, exploratory, look into the Scrum framework, and offers advice about how to think about it, and how to use it. Some of this advice is philosophical, some is pragmatic, some is practical, and some of it is controversial.

Interested in taking your cycling to the next level with clip-in pedals?  Whether you ride a road bike, mountain bike or commuter bike, clip-in pedals will help you to ride more efficiently, produce more power, especially when ascending the local hills, and be more confident in your handling by being more &#39;connected&#39; to your bike.  The rigid connection allows you to engage a better control of balance.  Imagine utilizing the power from your legs as they move up, pulling the pedal, as well as when you push down on the pedals.  Pulling up with your opposite leg while the other is pushing down creates a better distribution of the workload across both legs simultaneously.   
Ready to join us for this free clinic providing you with the tips and tricks to quickly learn how to use your clip-in pedals and how to easily and safety unclip at intersections, stop signs and refueling stops?  Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll need to do to prepare for the clinic and what you&#39;ll need to bring along to get the most out of it:
1) If you don&#39;t already own a pair of clip-in specific cycling shoes, stop by Sports Basement several days in advance to try some on, ask questions of our knowledgeable cycling staff and make your purchase so you may bring them to the clinic.  Doing this in advance will also provide enough time for your size to be located should it not be available that day.
2) Take a look at the clip-in pedal selection and discuss your options and what is recommended for your type of riding.  Purchase them if you&#39;re ready or wait for the clinic when we&#39;ll discuss your options and the comparative benefits.  If you have purchased pedals, we&#39;ll put them on your bike (if not already installed) and proceed to the parking lot to practice clipping in and out, starting and stopping and feeling comfortable and confident while riding this &#39;connected&#39; to your bike.
Bring the following gear:
- your bike
- cycling gear (helmet, riding apparel, cycling shoes and clip-in pedals)

 August 13 &amp; 14, 2012 | Sonoma, California
(9am Monday - 4pm Tuesday)

 
&#34;The art of communication is the language of leadership.&#34;— James Humes
The most fulfilling relationships, effective teams and successful change-efforts thrive in harmonious communications environments where connectivity and RESONANCE are high and where conflict, alienation and DISSONANCE are low and effectively harnessed and tamed when they appear.  
The 2012 Art of Communication | The Language of Leadership retreat will create a deep learning environment to allow participants to: 

 Expand their understanding of interpersonal/team communications dynamics and Relationship System Intelligence (RSI); 
·Enhance their capacity to effectively read and navigate complex communications   environments and challenges; 
 Develop an understanding of relationship systems theory and the impact oncommunications and connectivity among individuals and teams; and
 Develop a toolkit of exercises, tools and strategies to improve how they communicate(in personal and professional contexts) in the service of improved connections as leaders.

Additionally, participants will:

Develop skills to build quality long-term relationships based on communication andconnection;
 Increase their capacity to recognize and address ineffective interpersonal and teamcommunication patterns and develop a toolkit of strategies to enhance connectivity; 
Deepen their understanding and awareness of the impact their communication and “languaging” behaviors have in their personal and professional environments; and
Apply practical solutions to everyday situations to transform their work with individuals,teams and organizations.

We strongly believe that the beauty and flow of “Symphonic Truth” is created when the cacophony of voices making up the communications landscape are moved by design to a place of harmony. Each voice making an essential contribution, just like each instrument in a symphony. This harmonious effect is unmatched by any that a single ‘instrument’ could make on it’s own.

Why should you or your team members attend?
Investing in enhancing individuals’ capacity for emotional social intelligence leads to improvements in overall personal and professional performance.  Investing in YOU leads to:
•Increased productivity (indvidually and across teams), satisfaction, and fulfillment;            
•Reduced decision making time and increased transparency in information sharing; and
•Increased shared responsibility in problem solving.
 
The reward to organizations is just as great. Organizations that invest in connectivity, communications and leadership see:
•Improved talent retention as a result of more favorable work environment, therefore reducing turnover costs; and 
•Diminished resistance to change and uncertainty increasing teams self assessment of effectiveness. 
  This retreat is appropriate for individuals, team members or team leaders interested in improving their capacity to skillfully master a complex communications landscape. This includes mid- to senior-level managers and leadership (across sector), coaches, change-makers, and social service-oriented professionals.

Wednesday, August 15 at 4:30pm thru Sunday, August 19, 3:00pm  a workshop retreat led by Rev. Catherine Gammon  Combining a relaxed meditation schedule and teachings from the Zen tradition with the practice of imaginative writing, this late-summer retreat is designed to encourage intimate and creative study of the mind and provide the opportunity to immerse yourself in the restorative beauty of Green Gulch.   Engaging playfully with language as an opportunity to receive, express, study, and reveal our own presently arising body and mind, we will write together from prompts, and read aloud, listen, and respond to one another’s words. Our writings and responses are explorations, and our conversations are based in imaginative and emotional insight rather than craft or editorial critique. Our time together will be intimate and playful, and will offer everyone opportunities for participation and discussion.   Our daily schedule will include meditation, dharma teaching, writing and group discussion, as well as free time for rest, reading, and walking in the farm and garden, to nearby Muir Beach, and in the surrounding hills.   The work we do together is appropriate for participants at any level of writing experience. Our time is structured to include informal periods of reflection and formal periods of silent meditation as practiced in the Zen tradition. Meditation instruction will be offered as needed.


Limited scholarships also are available. See link below to inquire.

Description: Preparing for an audition can be overwhelming! Nailing your audition is an important skill in the musical theatre industry, but just as important is the work you put in before you’re on the hot spot. Come learn techniques that will make your next audition the best yet! We will cover topics such as preparing your resume, introducing yourself, choosing the proper song, and delivering a great audition. We will also discuss the casting process—understanding the other side of the audition process is important too!

A lot goes on behind-the-scenes in this laid-back section of Northern California, and the same thing can be said about our busy Concord branch. While it might be the climate or the ocean-born air that makes Concord especially conducive for training at our sublimation events, I personally believe it&#39;s the contribution made by branch manager Jim Isham&#39;s wife each year:  her wonderful zucchini bread.

LEMON Leadership is an incredibly dynamic leadership typing tool that has been used to quickly and effectively assist hundreds of business leaders worldwide in team building, corporate communication, problem resolution, organizational restructuring, succession planning and diversity initiatives. This eye-opening 2-hour seminar will assess your leadership type and give you a taste of how LEMON Leadership types can be effectively leveraged to increase your impact individually as well as in team contexts.
Overview of LEMON Leadership® 
Much has been written on leadership, but most writings focus on only two or three categories of leaders. LEMON Leadership expands our view of leadership to cover five distinct types of leaders: Luminaries, Entrepreneurs, Managers, Organizers and Networkers. LEMON Leadership helps you to identify which type of leader you are and shows you how to apply your specific characteristics within your organization. Understanding these leadership types uncovers keys to dealing with yourself and others in situations calling for different types of leaders.
Results from A Taste of LEMON Leadership® 
Upon completion, you will receive an assessment of your own leadership type. At a high level, you will understand each type’s characteristics, strengths and weaknesses, how each defines work, what each protects and initial insights on how to effectively communicate. You will also gain appreciation for each LEMON type as you learn why all five are necessary for a well-rounded and dynamic team.
Format and Details 
LEMON Leadership author, Brett Johnson, will lead you through a remarkable 2-hour session that includes LEMON Leadership assessment results, interactive teaching time and facilitated discussions. Brett has shared insights from LEMON Leadership to great acclaim with top leaders in business, government, religion, education and capital around the globe.
Dinner will be provided for those who attend, as well as course materials.
 
Hope to see you there! Bring friends!Get Brain-Savvy with All Types of People!
This 3-day certification program is based on Prof. Dario Nardi’s popular new book, Neuroscience of Personality.
“What’s the science behind the 16 Myers-Briggs personality types?” Your clients want to hear their training has a solid basis, especially when there is competition for resources and time. The good news: 5 years of hands-on brain research validates the Jungian framework that inspired the popular model of sixteen types. Dr. Jung’s model is dynamic, allowing a lot of room for individuality, and so too the brain. When we know how our brains work, for real, we gain incredible keys to understanding ourselves and others. 
 Who should attend? Anyone who coaches, counsels, facilitates, advises, instructs, leads, or otherwise works with people, including O/D professionals. This is particularly for those of us who use Temperament, the 16 types, Interaction/Social Styles, Cognitive Dynamics, Integral Theory, NLP, and similar models in their work. 
 How you will benefit? You will earn a certificate touting your brain-savvy knowledge of personality type along with specific how-to tips and tangible resources for use with your clients. This is not a science course, though you will learn a lot!
 How will organizations benefit? You will be able to offer a more integrated and scientifically-supported approach, including new tools and ways to implement sustainable practices. Increased buy-in and better-fitting results mean more satisfied people.
 What will you get? Continuing Education units, a certificate of completion, an alumni discount on training materials, qualification to purchase and provide feedback on an upcoming “Radiance Neurodynamics” assessment, and access to a slide deck and workbook.
 What will you learn? We will address two levels: people’s whole-brain patterns that are key to understanding how they focus their attention and make decisions; and the cognitive skill sets that vary individually, even among people of the same personality type. You will also learn specific coaching tips for each type and general neuroscience-based best-practices, including how to activate and support “creative expertise” and other in-flow states.
Continuing Education: In the past, Day 1 of the course has granted 6 hours of Myers-Briggs Continuing Education under &#34;APTi&#34; with the heading &#34;Brain Savvy Coaching for Leadership: Latest Brain Discoveries Linked to Personality Type&#34;. We expect it can do so again. Also, the 3-days as a whole grants 21 hours of Continuing Education for members of APA and NBCC. Days 2 and 3 do not grant M-B CE hours.
 Prework. This course starts with pre-reading, including Neuroscience of Personality, 8 Keys to Self-Leadership, and an hour-long video. You may take a pre-test to help you gather questions for when we meet.
Certificate completion. When you complete the 3-day training and pass the ethics quiz and the certification exam, you gain a certificate. 
Performance support. You receive a 30 minutes of consultation with Prof Dario Nardi.
Here&#39;s how you can reserve your seat today!
Fee: $1385 ($1185 for current APTi members, InterStrength®  alumni, and first THREE early birds)

—Wednesday: &#34;Brain Savvy Coaching for Leadership&#34;. Covers brain basics, personality type basics, and brain savvy coaching with personality type. (This day is open for anyone to attend and is a stand-alone event.)
—Thursday: &#34;Neuroscience of Type: Individual Differences&#34;. Covers individual difference among the 16 Myers-Briggs types, profiling your personal cognitive skill-set, skill-building, and emotional dynamics.
—Friday: &#34;Neuroscience of Type: Professional Development&#34;. Covers professional development, facilitation of activities that build cognitive skills, and exam preparation. 
If you have already attended Day 1 of the event, you may start with day 2. However, it&#39;s suggested you attend all 3 days as the material is fairly intensive.

Her first book app, &#34;Treasure Kai and the Lost Gold of Shark Island&#34; won &#34;Best in Category&#34; at the New Media Film Festival in San Francisco and has been selected for numerous Digital Storytime &#34;Tops&#34; lists including Top 25 Most Essential Book Apps for Kids.More and more, people are realizing we are in the midst of a discipleship crisis in the United States which is largely responsible for the state of the American church. At the same time, there is a wave of excitement about the current missional movement that has been bubbling up in the last 10-15 years that many people are hoping will stop the bleeding. The fundamental issue, however, is that unless we are able to disciple people well like Jesus did, any missional movement is unsustainable. 
Our general experience is that people are quite intrigued to hear how we&#39;ve used things like Huddles (a discipleship vehicle) and Missional Communities (a missional vehicle) to see discipleship and mission come alive in their church communities, looking more and more like the churches we see in the New Testament. This workshop is a time to look at some of the things we&#39;ve learned in the past 30 years, dealing with post-Christian contexts where as little as 1% of people attend church. It&#39;ll have teaching, discussion, breakout time with your team, a chance to actually experience Huddles and Missional Communities, worship and even time at the beach. We are intentionally capping the attendance for the workshop at 200 so you have a large amount of access to 3DM&#39;s team and whatever expertise/experience we bring to the table.If you&#39;re interested in seeing some different approaches to discipleship and mission, this workshop would be great place to enter into that discussion for you and your team.
DetailsNovember 2 - 3  Starting @ 9am on Friday and ending @ 5pm on Saturday. 
CostThe cost of the event will cover the expense of the dinner on the Friday night, all course materials, speaker fees and content of the workshop. Attendees must pick up the cost of their lunches, accommodation and transport.
 
FAQsWho will lead the workshop?The 3DM team will share the teaching and are all experienced practitioners in discipling, planting, leading, and multiplying Missional Communities and Huddles. Though our resources and models were initially explored in a European situation, the 3DM team have adapted the tools and methodologies in the United States over the last 10 years.What will the workshop be like?You will have a chance to hear teachings about discipleship and mission and how we are practically seeing those things worked out in local church contexts. You&#39;ll get to experience Huddles and Missional Communities (rather than simply hear the theory). There will be large amounts of Q&amp;A, consultations for your team with our team. Worship. Down time at the beach. It&#39;s really a great mixture of work, rest, practice, theory and team time. Who is the workshop for? Anyone who would like to come, but by-and-large, we strongly encourage you to come with at least one other person, and if possible, a team from your church community. If at all possible, it&#39;d be great to have the senior leader there so the whole team is exposed to these ideas. What does the fee cover?Your registration covers your time with us, your materials and the two dinner meals on Tuesday and Wednesday night. Accomodation and transport to and from the venue is not included.Fast Track To A Higher Level

 " class="notranslateLet your inner artist out! Most of us would love to be creative more often, but feel intimidated by the need to learn difficult techniques or a sense that we ‘aren’t very good at it’. In our hurry to compare ourselves to others, we often overlook our own peculiar strengths, and rather than develop our natural style, we give up altogether.  Instructor Della Heywood believes that we each should paint and create for the sheer pleasure of it, without fear of criticism from others and especially not from our own inner critic. If you’ve ever had a hankering to be creative, come to this class! Set your inner artist free and have fun without worrying about the results.Explore a wide variety of media - acrylics, watercolor, oils, charcoal, pastel, india ink - and learn naturally according to your own natural style. Easy printmaking techniques, collage and mixed media will be experimented with, as well as painting and drawing from life or your imagination. The classes will vary from week to week. The session is 3 hours long, with breaks for refreshments and chatting and ample time for sharing. Materials provided at cost, or bring your own, which means that if you wish to use a large canvas or a small canvas or a large sheet of good paper, the cost will range between $3 - $15, which is the actual cost of the item. Paints, brushes and other materials provided. Sliding scale fee, so no one who truly wishes to participate will be turned away. Please pre-register to hold your space. Cost: $30, sliding scale.Thursday evenings, 6:30pm - 9:30pmInstructor: Della HeywoodTO REGISTER, please use the form at the top of this page. INSTRUCTOR BIO: Della Heywood was born in Vancouver, BC and has lived in Northern California since 1980. In Vancouver, she first attended university to study Zoology; but after a few years her Artist stood up, flung off her lab coat and put on a painting smock for good. Enrolling at Emily Carr School of Art, Della studied painting, drawing, etching, printmaking, sculpture, photography and more. Through the years Della has created many commercial designs, murals for coffeeshops, book illustrations, and of course her own paintings. Having been exhibited in various galleries across North America and Europe, her work is now held in private collections around the world. Della&#39;s major influences have been varied, but she considers herself first and foremost a spiritual and visionary artist, bringing into view that which is hidden beyond the veil. She has taught a variety of art concepts to both kids and adults for many years, and looks forward to help you learn how to Paint your very own Way.

 A class on everything Holga!
 
 
 
The class will be divided into an hour of talk and demo and an hour of hands on shooting. During the lecture, we’ll give a brief history of toy cameras and the Holga, give a run down on getting a successful exposure, and introduce you to some cool techniques to achieve lomo effects. The second hour of class will be spent out and about getting on-the-spot pointers from Carol and Flee as you put our tips into action.
 
 
 
This class is geared for Holga shooters. If you have another toy camera, let us know and stay tuned for an upcoming class. If you don’t own a Holga, borrow one of our basic model Holgas for the class or get one of your own at a screaming class discount!

Writing Your First Android App
Wednesday, August 8 from 6:30 - 8:00 pm
Clare Bayley, Product Engineer, Hattery Labs
You use them, you abuse them - you’re not new to them. Mobile apps are the hottest thing in the industry right now, but the development process is often shrouded in mysterious software and complicated jargon. If you are interested in learning the basics of Android development, this class is for you!
You&#39;ll learn everything you need to build a fully functional Android application including: which software to use, how to architect your app&#39;s life cycle, and how to run your app on a device.
You will leave this session with:

An app on your phone that YOU wrote. It won&#39;t be Angry Birds, but it will still give you bragging rights.
Basic knowledge of how mobile apps work.
Everything you need to know to keep playing around on your own.


Prerequisites: Students should have a basic grasp of how programming works to get the most out of this class. Experience with Java is helpful, but not necessary. Zero prior experience with Android development is assumed.
Come with your laptop and, if you have one, an Android phone + USB cable. Some software installation will be required beforehand; instructions will be emailed to students before the class.

Clare Bayley finished her CS degree at MIT in January, then immediately threw all her stuff in an RV and drove to San Francisco. She is currently a product engineer at Hattery Labs by day and a semi-professional photographer and cat enthusiast by night. She was on a team that won a grand prize in Google&#39;s first ever Android Development Challenge and was recently named a &#34;CS Rockstar&#34; by the PhenomList.

Have you ever been in an argument with someone you care about, wishing you could get out but not knowing how? Maybe you were listening to yourself talk, sure that every word coming out of your mouth was just making it worse, but you couldn&#39;t stop yourself. Don&#39;t give up hope. There&#39;s a way out for you, and for all of us. You just have to be willing to lose.
As soon as anyone wins an argument, everyone loses. Really, the whole paradigm of winning and losing, of right and wrong, blame and responsibility, is what gets us into these messes in the first place. Letting yourself lose is the first step outside that old paradigm.
Do you want relationships that are more collaborative? Do you wish you could stop having to defend and protect yourself? Do you want the people you care about to feel gotten and supported? Do you want everyone to be on your side? Come spend the evening losing with the rest of us. When there&#39;s nothing left to lose, there&#39;s so much to gain!

介紹 ASQ-3™: 明白工具– 國語/粵語
 
日期：           2012年八月十日星期五，下午一至五時
講者：           Cynthia Chang, 咨詢顧問
 
所有訓練均於家庭支援中心舉行，地址：1663 Mission St. 
七樓會議室
 
英語的ASQ-3訓練將於八月十日上午八時卅分至下午十二時卅分舉行；西班牙語的ASQ-3訓練將於八月十五日下午一至五時舉行。

 
什麼是 ASQ-3tm ?
年齡和階段問卷（ASQ）是一個由家長填寫檢查一個月到五歲半大孩子發展的問卷。檢查幼童是計劃找出兒童是否有發展問題的有效能和有效率的方法，在最能產生效果時開始轉介／提供服務。ASQ為家長提供有關他們孩子強項以及需要的有用資料，並給他們機會談談任何他們對孩子發展有關的關注或問題。
 
為什麼使用ASQ-3tm?
研究告訴我們早期護理和教育對兒童如何發展有長期的影響。在兒童的頭三年內，重要的集中於兒童的發展需要和利用兒童天然能力學習。從幫助家庭識別他們孩子的強項和可能延遲，你在確保孩子有最佳的學習和成長機會擔任一個重要的角色。因為家長是ASQ檢查過程中的合作者，這是一個和他們孩子親連和學習更多有關兒童發展的好機會。
 
ASQ-3tm與DRDP 或其他評估有什麼不同？
家長參與是ASQ的重心。ASQ-3依賴家長觀察他們的孩子，和填寫有關他們孩子能力的簡單問卷。由家長填答發展問卷不只符合經濟效益，同時從借助家長對他們孩子的深切認識，加強檢查的準確性。當服務者和家長評審ASQ檢查結果時，這是服務者和家長分享他們的觀察，並與家長建立合作關係的好開始。
 
什麼人應參加訓練?
照顧一個月大至五歲幼童和想知道更多有關發展檢查以及如何執行ASQ-3的家庭托兒者和托兒中心、家庭資源中心職員，以及普及學前計劃職員。
 
我將學習什麼?  
你將學習發展檢查的重要性和價值，如何做ASQ-3評分，識別在檢查中參與家庭的策略，和在你提供的服務中如何包括ASQ-3。

BLS for Healthcare Providers Course Description The BLS Healthcare Provider Course is designed to provide a wide variety of healthcare professionals the ability to recognize several life-threatening emergencies, provide CPR, use an AED, and relieve choking in a safe, timely and effective manner.

By this point you may have heard of me and some of the work I do, called Noetic Field Therapy, (also referred to as Noetic Field Balancings or Balancings).  Someone you know might have spoken to you about this, saying something like &#34;I don&#39;t what happened, I can&#39;t explain to you what she does... all I know is that it&#39;s amazing.  You have GOT to try it!&#34;

Well, here&#39;s a chance to come and get a sense of what this phenomenal healing modality and I am all about!

Please only come if you have an authentic desire to learn about me or this work, or have an inner knowing that this might be for you.  This talk will be participatory and experiential.

I look forward to meeting you and introducing you to Noetic Field Therapy!
Here&#39;s what people are saying...
&#34;It is hard to describe exactly what and how a Noetic Field Balancing will impact you because it&#39;s been different for me every time. But what I can say is that the each time has been powerful, transformative and profoundly changed my life for the better as unconscious beliefs that I&#39;ve held are released. Dana has an uncanny and gifted ability to find and address whatever is coming through as blocks in my life. Sometimes it has been one particular theme and other times it&#39;s been multiple blocks which have been released in a session. The result is that I have been freed from my limiting beliefs, on a level that is much deeper than my mind. It feels like my personal growth has accelerated tenfold because of the sessions I have had with her. I&#39;m so grateful to have received the gift of Dana&#39;s work and her presence because my life is filled with more passion, growth and abundance than I ever could have imagined. Thank you Dana!&#34; - Karen C.
&#34;Dana Fonteneau is a POWERHOUSE and I feel blessed to have benefited from a few of the many tools in her arsenal.  Every time I leave her care, I feel alive and empowered.  She&#39;s warm, intuitive, very supportive, completely present, passionate and hilarious- a great combo for someone who helps you get to the next level in life!  Go see Dana now!&#34;  K.W.
&#34;I feel blessed to be in Dana&#39;s care.   She is intuitive, powerful, direct,  keeps it real, and has so many tools to bring in service.  I&#39;ve learned more about my authentic self and power with Dana&#39;s noetic balancing and SRI sessions than most therapies I&#39;ve tried.  She is an integral part of my ongoing transformation and I am so grateful she came into my life at the exact right time.  Thank you for your gifts, Dana!  And more importantly for giving of them so generously to help others.  If you are ready to show up as your best self, see Dana.&#34;  M.N.What You Will Learn:

 Companies put a lot of time and effort into cultivating a positive brand identity, and more and more do so through casual social media interactions. However, they don&#39;t always grasp the legal ramifications of what they are sharing, posting, and writing, which can cost them a lot of money and reputation points. When does a startup need to start legally protecting their brand, and how should they do that?

 This class will go through the legal issues that arise in social media and online communities, from user generated content to copyright infringement, to violation of celebrity right of publicity.  By the end of the class, you will be a pro on legal social media practices and know what your organization needs to do to maintain your brand and have a clear trademark strategy.

For more information, contact Shane Aidala at 408.856.6930 or shanea@rapidform.comDo you wonder what to say when visiting with your terminally ill loved one?
Is it painful to be near them because you feel helpless to ease their pain? 
Do you wish your final time together could be peaceful and fulfilling for you and for them?
 
The unique challenges of end-of-life care often leaves family members and other caregivers feeling frustrated, alone, and even despairing. But with help, you can learn how to make the most of your remaining time with a loved one with a terminal diagnosis.
 
In this 2 hour interactive workshop, Heidi will guide you to: 

avoid the 3 biggest mistakes family members make that lead to later regret 
learn quick techniques to help comfort your loved one and yourself even if you only have five minutes together
replace the feeling of not “knowing what to say or do” with calm confidence that your time together will be meaningful
discover the surprising reason why dodging difficult discussions can prevent peaceful passing 
find out about options for natural pain relief without the side effects of medication.

 
Heidi says, “A lot of people stop spending time with a loved one who’s in the final stages of life because they’re confused about what to do at the visits, or because they don’t have enough time and they don’t know that even a few minutes can make a huge difference. The techniques we teach are quick to learn and yet can bring tremendous comfort to both terminally ill people and their loved ones and caregivers. Imagine what it would be like if you could really cherish the life of your family member during this time. Then come and learn how.”

- How to use traction/hype to facilitate future product decisions, positioning, and future releases.

Dr. Lyle Koca: &#34;My journey into Chiropractic began at the age of 15 when I experienced a condition that disallowed me from enjoying my youth.  After suffering for weeks with lower back pain and taking drug after drug that did nothing to give me any relief and more importantly did not address the WHY I was suffering, I literally crawled across the street to our local Doctor of Chiropractic. From that moment on the passion to pursue and participate in this great profession began!!!&#34;
Dr. Koca is an honors graduate of Palmer College. While there he had an opportunity to intern and later become Head Intern at the famous Troxell Chiropractic Clinic.  This offered him an opportunity to work side by side with Dr. Larry Troxell who refined his skills with Dr. Clarence Gonstead.  As a result of this experience Dr. Koca attended hundred of hours of Advanced Gonstead Training and was allowed the opportunity to work side by side with many clinically advanced Doctors of Chiropractic.
After establishing Koca Chiropractic Clinic, Dr. Koca has remained an active member of the Omaha, NE community by speaking to many groups and organizations, both young and old, contributing to charities and has been chosen as the Best of Omaha on numerous occasions.
Dr. Koca is a member of the Nebraska Chiropractic Physicians Associate, The 100 Year Lifestyle Affiliate, The Wellness Champions, Chiropractic Leadership Alliance, Ultimate Achievers Club, Discover Wellness and has been a Chiropractic Coach/Consultant for other succeeding chiropractors.
Dr. Koca has been married to Shawn for over twenty-five years; they have a daughter Blaike who is evidence of his vision.  When not in the office or traveling for the profession Dr. Koca enjoys spending time with his family. 
&#34;The body is a self-regulating, self-maintaining organism that is controlled and regulated by the nerve system. If there is an interruption in the nerve system, the body’s ability to function fully is diminished.  Every experience you have is through your nerve system. If that interruption occurs the essence of life is diminished.  Doctors of Chiropractic are the only health professionals that detect this interruption, called a Vertebral Subluxation Complex.  It is our purpose to inspire, promote and celebrate healthy lifestyles by detecting the Subluxation and guiding our practice members to a new experience of life.&#34;CancellationWe do not issue refunds.  If you cancel or do not attend the course, you forfeit your payment.

 About Home Ec Cooking Classes
I learned how to cook by watching the cooks in the Chez Panisse kitchen, by carefully tasting and training my palate, and eventually by apprenticing and working in that kitchen.  That experience blew my mind open, and after several months in the kitchen I started to recognize patterns and rules common to every dish, no matter what the ingredients or particular methods of preparation.  I eventually came to realize that with a careful understanding of how to apply four basic elements, I could make anything taste delicious.  Over the past eleven years, everything I&#39;ve continued to learn in the kitchen has essentially been a refinement of my understanding of the application of salt, acid, fat and heat.  As a teacher of both professional and home cooks, it&#39;s my ultimate goal to give people the tools to become intuitive cooks and free them from the reigns of cookbooks, recipes, and measuring implements by helping them refine their palates, sensitivity in the kitchen, and understanding of basic kitchen science.  The most important lessons I share with my students are those that impart a fundamental understanding of universal tenets. I&#39;d like to invite you into the kitchen with me for this unique, empowering series of classes.  You&#39;re welcome to take as many or few as you like, but the series is designed as an immersion and elements of each class will interplay with the others to help give students a comprehensive understanding of cooking.In each class, I will describe and demonstrate for each element its roles and functions, basic science, and effects on taste in a dish.  We&#39;ll taste and discuss thoughtfully in an effort to give our palates a bit of contextual understanding.  And of course, because I believe so strongly in the power of experience (and muscle memory) you&#39;ll get a chance to put your new skills to use as we all cook a lovely meal together with the concepts of the day in mind.  In the evening, we&#39;ll retire to a table set in the back garden, eat our dinner, drink some wine, and I&#39;ll answer any further questions that may have arisen while we cooked.  You&#39;ll leave empowered and inspired to return to the kitchen, ready to practice your skills, refine your knowledge, and looking at food with a whole new perspective.  
Take a look at this sweet 90-second video shot by the folks at the San Francisco Chronicle at a Home Ec class held at 18 Reasons in 2012 to get an idea of how things work:
 
About &#34;Salt&#34;
Most professional cooks agree that knowing how to use and taste for salt properly is the single-most important skill a cook can have.  Using a combination of basic kitchen science (complete with diagrams!), personal narrative, and demonstrative cooking experiments, I&#39;ll help you understand the whys and hows of using salt in the kitchen so that you can be a more skilled and sensitive decision maker in your own cooking and more consistently produce delicious, balanced dishes.  
Home Ec: Understanding Salt will cover the following:-Different types of salt-Knowing when to salt-How to salt appropriately-What functions salt performs in a dish-How salt relates to acid and fat in a dish-How salty and sweet flavors interactTogether, we&#39;ll cook a variety of dishes for dinner using different cooking techniques to demonstrate the principles of salt.  
About Samin
A professional cook and freelance writer, Samin Nosrat looks to tradition, culture and history for inspiration. Trained in the Chez Panisse kitchen, she cooked there for several years before moving to Italy, where she worked closely with the Tuscan butcher Dario Cecchini and chef Benedetta Vitali for nearly two years. She spent five years as the sous chef and &#34;farmwife&#34; at Eccolo restaurant, butchering, brining, and preserving nearly everything in an effort to make the restaurant as self-sustaining as possible. 
Her work has been featured in the New York Times, Vogue, Wallpaper, NPR, and San Francisco Magazine, while her own writing has appeared in Martha Stewart Living, Yoga Journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, Meatpaper, Edible San Francisco, as well as on her blog, Ciao Samin. 

What Students Say About Home Ec and Samin
&#34;These classes will change the way you think in the kitchen.  I&#39;ve taken a lot of cooking classes over the years and stopped because I wasn&#39;t learning anything new.  I signed up for Samin&#39;s series because she&#39;s such a pleasure to be around and I was hoping to learn.  Learn I did!  The concepts she taught were simple and completely understandable.  The way fat, acid, and salt work together and counterbalance each other was fascinating.  The food we prepared was designed to demonstrate the concepts so that we could understand and remember.  There were several a-ha! moments.  It was worth every minute and every penny.&#34;&#34;Samin has an amazing knack for translating the inherent skills of a stellar restaurant chef to the everyday home cook.  While things like fat and acid might not sound all that sexy, you&#39;ll be amazed at how much better your cooking will be once you understand how they work.  If you have ever hoped to become more intuitive and less recipe-dependent in the kitchen, Samin&#39;s classes are perfect for you.&#34;&#34;Samin is more than a teacher, she is an inspiration. Her methodology goes way beyond recipes into how to think about cooking and even more importantly how to become a more visceral cook. The class I took with her has made me a much more confident and brazen cook!  Plus she is so much fun!&#34;

A new class, designed with the founders of the immensely powerful Organization &amp; Relationship Systems Coaching program (CRRGlobal) will be offered by ACI starting in November 2012!
Leading from the Next Level: Systems Oriented Leadership for Agile Coaches
Agile coaches are a new kind of leader!  With the old “command and control” mindset thoroughly discredited, a new framework is needed. The appropriate leadership paradigm for the age of complexity is a systems-oriented one which sees from the whole and stewards the authentic movement of the system rather than the opinions of the vocal.This systems oriented leadership is aligned with collaborative leadership competencies and a process-oriented focus. The new approach reveals a leader’s responsibility for the container rather than the content, for eliciting and catalyzing vision rather than driving or forcing one, for safeguarding the ability for every voice to be heard in service of gaining a complete perspective, and for creating environments of positivity that foster risk-taking, authenticity and creation.The competencies of systems oriented leadership include:

Ability to reinterpret the self through systemic experience, seeing oneself (and others) as a voice of the system
Holding the needs of the entire system, seeing all living systems as integrated, interconnected wholes
Knowing that leadership is a role of the system – rather than a personal position or permanent structure – which creates openness to influence, power sharing andthe application of collective intelligence
Creating an atmosphere of positivity, using authentic appreciation while avoiding toxic communication styles
Practicing deep democracy, hearing from every voice in the system to empower self-organization
Facilitating and catalyzing change, looking for, and nurturing, movements in the system that indicate the need to evolve to a new level of organization
Embracing and navigating conflict, leveraging conflict protocols andholding conflict as a positive change urge within the system rather than something to be “managed”
Fostering co-responsibility and peer accountability, wherein partners are responsible for each other’s success and failure and courageously hold each other accountable
Reads and articulates the emotional field, giving voice to the system’s experience in real time
Helps navigate levels of reality, flowing from base essence/urge, to visioning, to practicalities


Leading from the Next Level will explore these competencies, focusing on a fundamental mindset shift and basic skill development within the agile coaching context. Prerequisites 
In order to take Leading from the Next Level you must have taken one of the following:

The Coaching Stance class
CAT Integration – our new 6-week teleclass for those who have taken the Coaching Agile Teams class
Other professional coach training will be considered (e.g., Co-Active Coaching Fundamentals) –please contact us for approval



Our Instructors
Lyssa Adkins
Since 2004, I have taught Scrum to hundreds of students, coached many agile teams, and served as master coach to many apprentice coaches. In both one-on-one settings and small groups, I enjoy a front-row seat as remarkable agile coaches emerge and go on to entice the very best from the teams they coach. Prior to agile, I had more than fifteen years of expertise leading project teams and groups of project managers (I was even a PMO Director — twice!), yet nothing prepared me for the power of agile done simply and well.I believe that agile is more than an alternate project management methodology and I am passionate about deepening the roles in agile – specifically agile coach and agile manager – to help agile move into its fullest expression.I hold an alphabet soup of certifications: Certified Scrum Coach (CSC), Certified Scrum Trainer (CST), Project Management Professional (PMP), Six Sigma Green Belt (SSGB) and I am also a trained Co-Active Coach and Leader and, in 2012, I am pursuing certification in Organization and Relationship Systems Coaching.In 2010, I authored Coaching Agile Teams: A Companion for ScrumMasters, Agile Coaches, and Project Managers in Transition.

In a word, my professional work is about transformation.  I seem to be wired to help people, and systems, change.

Hatha Yoga- Based on Principles of Alignment
We bring awareness and refinement to each pose for balanced action.
Alignment before action brings greater stability, safety and freedom.
Movements are coordinated with the breath and designed to help students of all levels advance in their practice.  
 Beginning January 2012 and every third Saturday of each month, the African-American Museum and Library at Oakland will host writers workshops presented by Chatmon’s Books. Authors and co-owners Chandra &amp; Charles Chatmon will discuss the ways new and aspiring authors can get their start with their dream book along with discovering the publishing options available; the pros and cons, along with promotion and marketing tips for the new authors when their book comes out in print.
Informative, insightful, these workshops will not only prepare the new and aspiring authors for their journey in the book world, but will help them understand what it takes to become published and the costs involved in turning their thoughts into a book. Since 2005, Charles has encouraged many emerging writers to follow their dreams of becoming published, helping to create dozens of new authors and/or those who are on their way.
The AAMLO Writers Workshops are free to attend and run from 2:00pm -4:00pm. There is metered parking around the building, but the museum and library is accessible by taking AC Transit and BART.
If you plan on attending, please be prepared to have a pen, pencil and a notepad to write down all the valuable information we&#39;ll mention at each session. Thanks.Introduction to HTML5

www.CoreCommunity.com Startup Finance: Valuation
 


Learn how to value startups in this 2 hour class.
Valuation can make or break a company. As investors, entrepreneurs, employees and consultants it is very critical to understand the value of the startups we associate ourselves with.

There are many circumstances in which valuation is critical:
A. You are looking to raise funding for your company.
B. You are looking to invest in a startup.
C. You are looking to work for a startup and your success is tied to the startup’s success.
D. You are about to get paid in equity.
E. You are interested in selling your business.
 
Valuation is the key component that enables the sales and purchase activity of startups. It is the very component that enabled Insagram’s sale for $1 Billion and Facebooks valuation of $100 Billion (approximately). 
This class is purely focused on startup valuation with entrepreneurial and non-public valuation needs in mind. We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation strictly from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.
~~~
This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.  Attendees can expect to walk through a few financial examples of valuations. The valuation focus is strictly startups and all the exercise examples are based on startup models.
 
Why: Here are some recent valuation news items that reflect the importance of valuation.
 
- Instagram sells for $1 billion
- Palo Alto-based TIBCO Software buys LogLogic for $130M
- Redwood Shores-based Oracle acquires Taleo for $1.9 billion
- Hyperion Therapeutics has filed for an IPO with a goal to raise $57.5 M

Fishnet Follies School of Classic Burlesque is an Editor Pick in Diablo Magazine Best of the East Bay 2011:
Pint-sized performer and Fishnet Follies leader Mynx d’Meanor keeps things fun with her goofy sense of humor and easy directions. Don’t let her size fool you: This petite woman is a fiery, sensual vixen, well schooled in the art of the tease.

About Tony Abou-Ganim
Tony Abou-Ganim is widely regarded as one of the pioneering and leading bar professionals in the world. He has made countless national TV appearances on shows including TODAY, Iron Chef America, Good Morning America, CNBC, Fox News and more. Abou-Ganim is the author of The Modern Mixologist: Contemporary Classic Cocktails (Agate, 2010) which offers readers an in-depth look into spirits and ingredients available to today’s mixologist, both professional and amateur alike. This entertaining and informative journey will take readers from the early stages of the cocktail to what Abou-Ganim has come to deem “Modern Mixology.” Abou-Ganim also has a DVD to his credit, Modern Mixology: Making Great Cocktails at Home, and hosted the Fine Living program Raising the Bar: America’s Best Bar Chefs. Abou-Ganim has also won two Iron Chef America competitions; his first pairing cocktails with Iron Chef Mario Batali in “Battle Mango,” and most recently pairing cocktails in “Battle Tequila and Tortillas” with Iron Chef Jose Garces. His signature branded line of Modern Mixologist bar tools will be released summer 2012. Abou-Gamin is also a partner at Inoteca Liquori in New York City.
Abou-Ganim grew up in the bar business, learning the craft from his cousin Helen David at the Brass Rail Bar in Port Huron, Michigan. His initial introduction to the business was steeped in the tradition of classic cocktails and professional barmanship, teaching him the necessary steps to become a leader in the beverage industry. After graduating from college, Abou-Ganim further developed an appreciation for a hand-crafted cocktail using only the freshest ingredients while working at Jack Slick&#39;s Balboa Café and then during the opening of &#34;Harry Denton&#39;s,” a legendary hangout in Fog City. In 1993 he moved to New York City and took a position as the opening bartender at Po, Mario Batali’s first restaurant.
Tony later returned to San Francisco to open Harry Denton&#39;s Starlight Room atop the Sir Francis Drake Hotel and it was here that he developed his first specialty cocktail menu featuring several of his original cocktail recipes including the Sunsplash, Starlight and his most famous of them all, the Cable Car.
In 1998, Abou-Ganim was selected by Steve Wynn to develop the cocktail program at Bellagio Las Vegas. He not only implemented his philosophy of bartending and drink preparation, stressing both quality ingredients and proper technique, but also created several original cocktails for the resorts 22 bars. In 2002 he won the Bacardi Martini World Grand Prix – one of only two Americans to ever win this title.
As the National Ambassador of the U.S. Bartenders Guild, www.usbg.org, and Associate Member of the Museum of the American Cocktail, www.museumoftheamericancocktail.org, Abou-Ganim continues to educate about the history and lore of cocktails. He also operates his own beverage consulting firm specializing in bar staff training, product education and cocktail development.
Abou-Ganim is currently working on his upcoming book dedicated to the often overlooked spirit, vodka, which is scheduled to be released in January 2013.

The 4T class taught me that life is a buffet. You can have anything you want, you just have to get up and serve yourself.       S.M., 4T student 

Soon after taking the 4T program I became debt-free and was well on my way to becoming independently wealthy. My needs are now easily met and my desires are now spontaneously fulfilled. I am truly grateful for this life-changing program. I am truly blessed and prosperous from having taken it. I most highly recommend it to anyone seeking prosperity.        J.C., 4T student

The 4T Prosperity Program changed my life. My students and I now know that we are powerful creators. During this 12-week program, and beyond, we have each experienced things such as new jobs and pay raises, large stock dividends, new homes, health miracles and loving relationships. We cannot wait to do another class – we changed our minds and changed our lives with the 4T Prosperity Program!      J.B., facilitator and 4T student

With any questions:  info@sourcephotographysf.comIn this 3-hour workshop, master vocalist Ed Reed guides students through the art of interpreting a lyric. Students sing a song of their choice with a professional accompanist. Topics include pronunciation, breathing, and phrasing as suggested by the nature of the lyric, as well as methods of communicating the story of the lyric to highlight emotion, nuance and irony.
While Ed Reed has been singing since he was a child, he released his first recording at the age of 78 and in the four years since, released two others. Reed’s ability to get inside a lyric has been noted by numerous reviewers. DownBeat wrote in 2011, “When Ed Reed sings…look for an intimate story every time…he establishes a connection to the lyrics and phrasing that is both beautiful and uncanny.” An inspiration on every level, Mr. Reed has been conducting workshops and classes at the Jazzschool over the last four years and has left an impression on all the students he’s come in contact with. Students of all levels are welcome. Maximum enrollment: 10 students.

Boost your confidence on the dance floor

Let’s see if this sounds familiar: you&#39;re out at a bar, nursing a beer and bobbing your head to (some version of) the beat, while the rhythmically-inclined people rock out on the dance floor.  Well sir, your days as a wallflower have come to an end. 
This 2-hour workshop offers relaxed, practical instruction in the basics of rhythm, footwork, and style, along with key moves that will help novice dancers boost their confidence and enjoyment on the dancefloor. You&#39;ll soon be leading the charge onto the dance floor at clubs, weddings, and perhaps even the occasional flash mob. (Hey, dream big, right?)

Instructor Bio:Annemarie brings a decade of experience instructing dancers of all levels and ages.  A lifelong dancer herself, she has choreographed, trained and performed with hip hop and jazz dance companies throughout the Bay Area.  As an instructor she loves helping novice dancers discover their confidence and style through movement.  Most of all, she encourages her students to let loose, feel rhythm, and enjoy life while working up a serious sweat.

Bring a Windows, Mac, or Linux laptop and we’ll install, set up, use, and bend Git into workflows that weren’t even possible with the version control systems of yesteryear. Be prepared to rethink how lightweight, fast, and refreshing source code control and distributed collaboration can be.

Basic use of the command line, whether in Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, or UNIX.
A laptop computer with Windows, Mac OSX (Snow Leopard or Lion), or Linux
Administrator privileges on the laptop

KATHY FETTKE, CEO, REAL WEALTH NETWORK
Host of The Real Wealth Show
Kathy is an active real estate investor, licensed Realtor, certified coach, and former mortgage broker.  She founded Real Wealth Network in 2003 to help investors avoid the “scammers” and get the right price on the best income properties in the strongest markets.  Kathy, and the team at Real Wealth Network, focus on helping their members build and preserve their real estate portfolios through creative finance and planning. With a passion for researching and sharing the most important facts on real estate and economics, Kathy is frequently featured on such media as CNN, CNBC, NPR, CBS MarketWatch and the Wall Street Journal. She hosts The Real Wealth Show on KABC Radio in Los Angeles which is also a featured podcast on iTunes with listeners in 27 different countries.
Kathy received her BA in Broadcast Communications from San Francisco State University and worked in the newsrooms of CNN, FOX, CTV and ABC-7. She’s past-president of American Women in Radio &amp; Television.
Kathy became a certified personal coach through the Coaches Training Institute in San Rafael, California. In 2001, she took the coaching process to television and produced a cable show called &#34;DREAM&#34; which followed the process of 6 people going after their dreams over 90 days.
Kathy noticed a theme on her Dream coaching show: most people didn&#39;t have time for their dreams when they are spending all their time at work to make money for bills. Her show sponsor was a real estate expert and the segments they produced changed her life. After interviewing dozens of real estate millionaires, Kathy discovered their secrets to creating passive income streams. She and her husband bought numerous investment properties and since then learned the highs and lows of investing that can only come from hands-on experience. She is passionate about learning more and sharing that information with the members of Real Wealth Network and the listeners of The Real Wealth Show.

Using Typography to Improve Design and User Experience 
Thursday, September 6th from 6:30 - 8:00 pm
Carolina de Bartolo, Author, Instructor &amp; CEO, 101 Editions
It’s likely that language will be a user’s first experience with your business, so the question is how can you make that language sing? The answer: Typography. Studies have demonstrated that when type is set well, it improves the mood, comprehension, and cognitive skills of the reader. As a result, increasing numbers of executives and entrepreneurs are realizing that typography matters to their brand, their customers, and their success.
In this introductory class, you will learn what typography is, why it matters, and several key features of good typography. You’ll also learn to see typography with a critical eye, enabling you to make better choices about it in your own work going forward, whether in branding decisions, user experience, or just crafting a new résumé.
No prerequisites required. No materials/software required. 
Carolina de Bartolo has taught typography and design history for more than a decade and is the author and creator of the popular typography textbook Explorations in Typography: Mastering the Art of Fine Typesetting and its companion app.

Are you a seasoned performer or is the stage foreign territory? Do you like to make stuff up or do you get nervous at parties? Do you sing in the shower or do you want to loosen up?Regardless of your experience, background or training, we think EVERYBODY can benefit from studying improv. This six-session class is a fun intro to the joys and thrills of improvisation and the BATS Improv style.Students learn improv vocabulary, use practical skills, and perform in a friendly atmosphere. Foundation I is all about unleashing your innate skill. You&#39;ll play games and experiment with creating characters and scenes.Key concepts in Foundation 1 include:    * Spontaneity    * Making Offers (blocking and accepting)    * Storytelling/Narrative    * Status    * Endowments    * Where/Space Objects (creating &#34;props&#34; and &#34;locations&#34; out of thin air)Some of the lessons of this six-week course: Have fun. Accept the audience&#39;s ideas. Make your partner look good. Start positive. Pay attention. Fail &#34;good naturedly.&#34; Make eye contact. Avoid asking questions in scenes. Mime as well as you can. &#34;Yes, and...&#34; Dare to be dull. Accept your own ideas. Explore flexible status.In short, there&#39;s plenty to cover. And you&#39;ll be amazed at how the lessons apply to your life both on and off stage. Like we said, there&#39;s no experience necessary.At the conclusion, everyone &#34;passes&#34; and can move on to Foundation 2, but you can also take Foundation 1 as many times as you would like and are sure to get something new out of it each time.(For some folks, this all the improv they could ever want or need!)

You will forge lasting professional relationships with teammates and worthy opponents as you quickly hone your business model design skills.  
Background
In July 2010, Alex Osterwalder and Julian Keith Loren hosted a Business Model Camp at Hub Berkeley. Attendees redesigned complex, real-world Social Enterprise business models (triple bottom line, targeted at the sparse-infrastructure regions in the developing world, etc.). Using these business models provided a level of challenge that was great for team-based learning and represented humanitarian, environmental, and social causes that were easy to rally behind. 
In February 2011, Julian and Alex joined with Karen Herzog, Amy Barr, and Lisa Kay Solomon to premier Business Model Gameference at Hub SoMa. Competing teams designed completely different business models and then gained points by critiquing each others work in playful, high-energy face-offs. Players walked away with new or honed business design skills, with a deeper appreciation of their value in a business model design team, with skills in identifying the &#34;minimum viable constraint set,&#34; and with new friendships.
Innovation Management Institute has since run numerous private Business Model Gameferences as well as themed Business Model Games at Stanford University and UC Berkeley. Don&#39;t miss the new and vastly-improved Business Model Gameference premiering on August 25, 2012 and touring globally in October and November!Class runs from 11am to 2:30pm. The starting location is Mr. Pollo: 2823 Mission Street (bet. 24th and 25th St.). The class will finish with cooking at La Cocina: 2948 Folsom Street (bet. 25th and 26th St.).
Parties That Cook has teamed up with Epicurean Concierge, Lisa Rogovin, to bring you an in-depth culinary adventure set in San Francisco&#39;s famous Mission District where the traditional and often lusty Latino and South American flavors are a part of a changing community of various backgrounds and cultures.
Bring your appetite and a bottle of water and meet your guides at Mr. Pollo on for the first half of the event - an exciting culinary tour of the Mission. Tasting tour stops may include Wise Sons Deli, freshly baked mini cupcakes from Mission Minis, authentic tacos from El Farolito, and award-winning ice cream from Humphry Slocombe. Finally, stop into La Palma Foods, a Mexican market where you&#39;ll see some of the ingredients you&#39;ll later learn to cook with. TOUR STOPS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.
The moving tour ends in the kitchen at La Cocina, a business incubator that cultivates low-income food entre­pre­neurs as they for­mal­ize and grow their busi­nesses by pro­vid­ing afford­able com­mer­cial kitchen space, industry-specific tech­ni­cal assis­tance and access to mar­ket oppor­tu­ni­ties. There you&#39;ll join the Parties That Cook chefs for an exciting hands-on cooking class featuring the exotic flavors of the Mission. Enjoy a lively introductory cooking demo featuring tips such as the fastest way to dice an onion without a tear. Then, break into teams and learn to prepare recipes from the day&#39;s Latin-inspired small plates menu, all while listening to upbeat music. When the cooking is over, you&#39;ll savor the &#39;fruits&#39; of your labor hot from the oven!

Follow Your Callings: A Hands-On Workshopwith: Gregg Levoy Date: September 30, 1:00-4:00pm Cost: $30Any leap you want to make in your personal or professional life that will align or re-align you with your passion and sense of purpose, with your deepest values, with a fit between who you are and what you do is, by definition, a calling–an urging from the deep self that tells you what it will take to make your life literally “come true.”
That calling could be to make a career change or creative leap, take on a new role or let go of an old one, launch a new venture or a new relationship, or simply make a course-correction in your life or work. This dynamic, humorous and hands-on workshop will take a creative approach to the challenges of listening and responding to these calls. While honoring a calling’s essential mystery, we’ll also explore the questions that bloom naturally in the presence of any call: What does it ask of us? How do we tell the true call from the siren-song? How do we handle our resistance to it? What happens when we say no? What happens when we say yes? The key issues explored will be:
 


Clarifying your callings


Working with the resistance that naturally arises


Identifying who and what can help you make the changes


Creating an action plan of specific steps to anchor your callings in the world


Gaining a renewed sense of direction and possiblities


 
Gregg Levoy is the author of Callings: Finding and Following An Authentic Life. As a full-time lecturer and seminar-leader in the business, educational, human-potential and faith-based arenas, Gregg has keynoted and presented workshops for many organizations including at the Smithsonian Institution, the Environmental Protection Agency, Microsoft, the Universities of California, and has been a frequent guest of the media, including ABC-TV, CNN, NPR and PBS.

Are YOU ready to date the girl of your dreams?
Whether you’re a newbie to dating, or have been studying the art of attraction for years, you’ve likely come to this page for one reason:
YOU WANT MORE SUCCESS WITH WOMEN.

At the ABCs of Attraction, this is our ONE AND ONLY goal for our students.
By signing up for our bootcamp, we GUARANTEE that you will get:


Exclusive and field tested tactics, routines, and stories that utilize being Asian (or other) to YOUR ADVANTAGE for Interracial Dating &amp; Pick-up SUCCESS!
20 hours worth of training over 3 days and 2 nights
The workshop section has four to five hours of seminars, lectures, &amp; intense interactive drills
FREE Pre-bootcamp Package that includes assignments, missions, and homework specially designed to get you READY and WARMED up BEFORE the bootcamp!
FREE Pre-bootcamp Phone Consultation with an ABCs staff member to go over your homework and prepare you for the big day!
FREE Bootcamp Workbook over 100 pages that will give you EVERYTHING that you need to make meeting women EASY
A detailed understanding of the unique, intuitive, and easy to understand and implement ABCs Structure:

The ONLY HOLISTIC mind &amp; body form of pick-up that combines:

Inner Game (10 Pillars of Strength &amp; Lifestyle)
Outer Game (Subcommunication &amp; Bodylanguage)
Verbal Attraction (Bantering &amp; Storytelling)



Then the fun starts!

Each evening, students head out to local hotspots with our instructors for a night of socializing with the kind of women they have only dreamed of before.
Our 3:1 student – instructor ratio offers each ABCs student as much 1-on-1 help as they can handle. And after each in-field exercise is a debriefing session where students can get feedback on how they did.
Often times, our students meet someone special during the bootcamp, which alone can be well worth the price of attending.

AND HERE IS THE BEST PART:
Head instructor JT the Asian Playboy does not belong to any large corporation, and is not interested in fly-by-night schemes. He is interested in YOUR SUCCESS, and has designed a program that keeps students in REGULAR contact with instructors through meetings and our internet boards.
In other words, THIS IS NOT A ONE- WEEKEND THING.
We have gotten tired of hearing stories where a guys takes a bootcamp at another company, gets some success, and then slowly loses his skills. THIS IS NOT TRUE INSTRUCTION, but a temporary fix.
After YEARS of teaching his own highly successful bootcamps, APB has designed a SPECIALIZED program of hardcore instruction combined with multiple follow up meetings. Our alumni have a chance to meet with their instructors even AFTER they graduate from the bootcamp.
We believe our students are a reflection of our company, and our goal is to assure that all of them are successful. Where other companies cut contact with students when the bootcamp ends, your bootcamp is an induction into a brotherhood of amateur and veteran social artists who truly want to help each other.
And guess what? WE DON’T CHARGE EXTRA FOR THE FOLLOW-UP REUNIONS.
This is not some scheme where we raised the prices of our programs.
APB has chosen to offer FREE follow-up events because he is dedicated to seeing his students grow and become successful with women. Having learned from the best, APB understands that, while a bootcamp can skyrocket your success, follow up is essential to truly develop your social skills.
Here is what some students are saying about our program:

The ABCs of Attraction is one of the rare companies that offers programs like this, which is why we have had such a high student success rate.
We view teaching as more than a method. We see it as a MOVEMENT of men learning how to properly socialize, interact and date women.
Now you can learn the A-F secrets of how to meet beautiful women and begin your own journey of personal improvement.
Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s time?
EMPOWER YOURSELF!

The classes are hosted by the founder of PhysioEmoDynamics Institute. It&#39;s for all levels, meaning that if you&#39;ve never practiced PhysioEmoDynamics or you&#39;re an experienced practitioner, you&#39;ll feel at home, challenged, and at ease. During each session you will experientially learn how to achieve immediate results for unnecessary pain, suffering, and illness – any time it occurs. Together we will quickly access and heal the root causes for Physical, Mental, and Emotional Suffering or each attendee.
The PhysioEmoDynamics System employs intuitive, compassionate touch and kinesthetic modalities to create a pleasant sensory experience during each class.
The transcendental character of the music is carefully selected to assist attendees in experiencing a collective state of bodily transcendence, similar to that of ancient shamanic dancing ritual, trough hypnotic, pulsing melodies and rhythms... all to design the environment of joy and unification with each other in Love, while your body moves. During each class of PhysioEmoDynamics there are three major steps in the process of permanently releasing the stored tension and energetic blockages:

Identification,
Liberation,
Integration.

By giving proper attention to the body and to the senses, the session proceeds smoothly and efficiently. PhysioEmoDynamics uses a blend of physical, emotional, energetic, and cognitive healing techniques to intuitively and rapidly resolve the root cause of pain, suffering, and illness. The PhysioEmoDynamics System does this by activating and enhancing your own mind’s natural self-healing abilities to untangle self-defeating neural clusters and re-architect your mental structures so that you become the ~you~ you have always known you can be. And you ~can~ be that you sooner than you expect - it will take just 2 dyas of dancing breathing and mindfully working with your body.
 
The PhysioEmoDynamics events are your best choice when:


You are ready to step past the routine roller coaster ride
You are ready to experience a Rapid Resolution of Energetic Blockages
You are ready to discover both a quick fix and a permanent change
You are ready to let go of the baggage that holds you back and slows you down
You are ready to HAVE FUN!


This set of 2 classes will show you that letting go of negative emotions is as easy and quick as throwing out the kitchen trash. You will be free to discover your life’s true purpose, beyond “getting better”, with a mind full of clarity, ready to experience your birthright of joy and fulfillment.

Welcome to the Compact Series
 The Compact Series are low or no-cost sessions designed for leaders in transition.  They are designed to tease apart the difference between a career &amp; a job.    
 
In ...Career Exploration – Doing what you love to do
Career exploration and transition is an opportunity for you to take control of your future! Sometimes career explorations are triggered by career transitions:
You will learn how to:
·         Unpack your strengths through an inventory
·         Learn  personality types to help you in teaming and working on the job
·         Map your strengths &amp; skills to professions  
 
In...Resumes, Bio’s and LinkedIn—What’s Your Story?
You need to tell a story.  Whether it is a resume, biography, or some type of online presence a story is demanded.  There’s debate, is the resume dead, yes or no?  The answer is it depends.   Recruiters, and those interested in learning more about you, will Google you and assess your talents based on your social media profiles.   That said, some recruiters might ask for a resume to share with their hiring managers.  
You will learn:
·         What words to BAN from your resumes? 
·         Create an online biography
·         Learn the basics of LinkedIn &amp; set up your profile
·         Learn how to manage your online profile 
 
 In ... Informational Interviewing
The data is telling us it takes on average, twelve to eighteen months to find a senior-level executive position and six to twelve months to find a non-executive role.  That’s lost time you cannot get back if you start on the wrong foot.  
You will learn:
·         How to establish a rapport &amp; trust during the interview
·         Articulate how your strengths and skills match career targets
·         Solicit real-time feedback on your career targets with people already in the industry

Sahaja meditation is a unique method of meditation based on an awakening that can occur within each human being. 
Through this process an inner transformation takes place by which one becomes moral, united, integrated and balanced. 
One can actually feel the all pervading divine power as a cool breeze, as described in all traditions of the world. This is the actualization of such transformation, which is taking place now, worldwide, and has been proved and experienced by hundreds of thousands in over 85 countries.

Clutter may manifest in both blatant and subtle ways. The symptoms and
patterns of our compulsion are as numerous as there are clutterers. The amount
of clutter in our lives is not as important as the desire to stop cluttering.
If you want help, you can find it in the Clutterers Anonymous fellowship. 

We believe that we can recover from cluttering and use our experience to
benefit others. We believe we are entitled to surroundings of serenity and
order and joyous lives. We simplify our lives, believing that when we need a
fact or an item, it will be available to us. We nurture our spirit by
surrounding ourselves with beauty and harmony.

 New students must attend a 45-minute Introductory Meeting prior to their first class (usually offered an hour before class). Please email ellen@trikashala.com to schedule your Intro.  Weekly classes are held at 2910 Camino Diablo Blvd, Walnut Creek (ExecuCenter complex). Ample Free Parking. Directions and suite number will be provided when you sign up for your Intro.
Kundalini Meditation is an ancient Tantric practice that allows each individual to deeply experience their own direct, inner connection to the Divine.  This practice focuses on awakening the powerful transformative force called &#34;kundalini&#34;-- the Divine energy that is always present, already within every human being. When it flows through us, kundalini can wash away our deepest tensions, expand the flow of creative energy in us, and eliminate our misunderstandings about our true nature.  As we stay attuned to this vital force, we experience a profound growth that leads to love and spiritual fulfillment in our lives. The essence of this practice is about finding that sacred space within where the individual heart is merged into the heart of the Divine. That experience reveals our total unity with Divinity.  Shaktipat is the transmission of a living spiritual energy. The term literally means &#34;the descent of grace,&#34; and it is a vitally important presence in the awakening of the kundalini. Shaktipat allows for the direct transmission of energy from teacher to student.  Ellen Jefferds has been a student of Swami Khecaranatha since 2007. Previously, she taught another form of meditation for over 30 years. Her fulfilling experience with Kundalini Meditation inspired her to make a deep commitment to this practice and to become a teacher in Swami Khecaranatha&#39;s lineage.  Swami Khecaranatha is the director of TrikaShala/Sacred Space Yoga Sanctuary at Rudramandir in Berkeley. He is an authentic adept and lineage holder of Tantric Shaivism in the Shaktipat Lineage of Bhagavan Nityananda and Swami Rudrananda.Monday Nights, $20 to reserve one space. On site $50 option for 4 consecutive classes (one miss ok). Hoops provided. Wear comfortable clothes to learn dance routines at each student&#39;s level.

Today&#39;s 401 (k)
retirement plans will not fulfill the implicit promise they represent for
Americans hoping to retire in comfort.  Various factors have contributed to Americans shifting more and more of their assets into
stocks/mutual funds/401k plans over the years.  This has led to a common myth that Americans need to take on risk to grow their savings.  Our workshop will destroy that notion and show you once and forever how to safely put away money and make it work as hard as possible for you providing multiple benefits that Wall Street and your local banks simply cannot duplicate!

Rsvp: by speaking to facilitator Samsarah Morgan 510-496-3491­  About the facilitator:   I am the proud mother of 5 grown sons and the grandmother a 10 year old grandaughter, and of a feisty and sweet 5 year old grandson. One of the things that most impressed me as a young mother was the deep well of love which my sons shared with me. I was saddened that the world I lived in did not prepare me for the sensitivity and sweetness my sons displayed on daily basis. I was also un prepared for the alomst daily pressure for this society it an attempt to &#34;make a man&#34; out my son, by encouraging me to discourage thier needs for bonding and emotional support.
 I also became aware of the importance of my own mental and emotional health and how this could and would impact my sons.  The society we live in already sees them as a problem - and attacks them. I did not want my unhealed issues, nor unrealized goals to do the same. I am honored to provide this circle as a safe harbor for like minded mothers, who wish to send strong confident men into the world.... And to be strong confident women as well.

  Startup Finance: Valuation
 


Learn how to value startups in this 2 hour class.
Valuation can make or break a company. As investors, entrepreneurs, employees and consultants it is very critical to understand the value of the startups we associate ourselves with.

There are many circumstances in which valuation is critical:
A. You are looking to raise funding for your company.
B. You are looking to invest in a startup.
C. You are looking to work for a startup and your success is tied to the startup’s success.
D. You are about to get paid in equity.
E. You are interested in selling your business.
 
Valuation is the key component that enables the sales and purchase activity of startups. It is the very component that enabled Insagram’s sale for $1 Billion and Facebooks valuation of $100 Billion (approximately). 
This class is purely focused on startup valuation with entrepreneurial and non-public valuation needs in mind. We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation strictly from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.
~~~
This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.  Attendees can expect to walk through a few financial examples of valuations. The valuation focus is strictly startups and all the exercise examples are based on startup models.
 
Why: Here are some recent valuation news items that reflect the importance of valuation.
 
- Instagram sells for $1 billion
- Palo Alto-based TIBCO Software buys LogLogic for $130M
- Redwood Shores-based Oracle acquires Taleo for $1.9 billion
- Hyperion Therapeutics has filed for an IPO with a goal to raise $57.5 M
- 41st Parameter raised $13M in a Series D funding
- Viadeo raised $32M in funding for its professional networking service

 About Michelle Lenehan: 
After graduating from U.C. Berkeley, Michelle began her career as property manager for a large real estate firm in San Francisco. She grew into an escrow assistant position and then entered wholesale lending where she worked as an account executive for National City. Michelle spent the next 13 years in the title industry becoming a leading sales representative for Fidelity National Title, earning acclaim as a top producing sales representative and affiliate of the year for her local realtor association. With a passion to understand and teach real estate related issues to others, Michelle’s role with the company suits her perfectly. Michelle has become integral to ForeclosureRadar in teaching agents, investors and homeowners to understand the foreclosure market and to create the best opportunities for themselves. 
About ForeclosureRadar: 
The mission at ForeclosureRadar is simple: To bring transparency, efficiency and honesty to the foreclosure marketplace. The foreclosure process has been shrouded in darkness for too long. Get-rich-quick gurus and disreputable list peddlers have thrived in this darkness, manipulating consumers and real estate professionals alike. People who needed help were hard pressed to get it.  ForeclosureRadar is ending this. 
Achieving this mission starts with credible, up-to-date data. ForeclosureRadar is the only place to get reliable information on properties in every phase of the foreclosure process. This includes preforeclosure (when a homeowner is given a notice that they are in default), auction (when the lender takes bids on foreclosed property in a public forum), and REO (or real estate owned, where the lender takes ownership of a property that fails to sell at auction).Consumers, investors and real estate professionals no longer have to scrape together scattered information to make informed decisions. 
ForeclosureRadar has also created a free online community, ForeclosureTruth.com, where participants in the foreclosure market can interact more efficiently. Consumers find Realtors specializing in foreclosures; Investors source service providers; Lenders connect with brokers to move properties more efficiently. It&#39;s all there, out in the open. 
But underneath the data, beyond the Website, lies our real difference: An unflinching commitment to speaking the truth about the foreclosure marketplace. Foreclosure is an unpleasant process. There are human beings behind the numbers. Those who want to get rich quick should seek other venues. It&#39;s time to clear the air of hype. Creating a foreclosure market that works better for everyone requires nothing less. 
Please note that online registration for this event will be open until 12:00 (noon) PM on August 1. After this time registration will only be available at the door and the price will increase to $30 - payable only by cash or check.

The instructors of the ABCs team really took care of me, and I got to meet awesome fellow students who are nothing but nice guys trying to be successful with women.”-AlphaZ ( Los Angeles, CA ) “[ Andrew has ]Zero AA, Charming, Charisma. I said to myself, I wanna be like that. This was just a preview of Andrew’s Skillz of what was to come.”- Apex ( San Fran, CA) “The instructors were amazing. They knew my weaknesses and committed to helping me with them. Did not bullshit me or sugarcoat anything. They said it like it was. I&#39;m a very skeptical person but they made a believer out of me.”-Goodwood ( Houston, TX ) “Back at the VIP location, no one&#39;s there. A few minutes Later, BAM! Andrew comes in with 3 Smokin Hot Indian Chicks! Tall, Slim, Heels, Long Legs, Short Dresses. Immediately, I squish my self in between them. My big mistake here was I needed to pick JUST ONE and concentrate on just one… All 3 of them looked like Models to me. It was SENSORY OVERLOAD!”-Apex ( San Fran, CA)  (Do you have what it takes to be an ABCs Bootcamp Graduate? Apex in Action!) “I will share one thing that Andrew taught me cuz it is very important... we are all human beings looking for a connection... and those that know how to connect to people will be better for it... with women and life.

We don&#39;t have to compete each other and have enough class and discipline a lot of &quot;other&quot; people/PUAs don&#39;t have.”-Goodwood ( Houston, TX )

About your Instructor
 
After being diagnosed with skin cancer on his face, Devon Ash went through a bout of depression that robbed him of his once natural social ability. Fortunately, he was able to recover stronger than before with the research and implementation of skills within social psychology and human behavior. With these new-found social skills, Devon learned that social behaviors could be formalized, scientifically confirmed, and, most importantly, adopted by anyone.
 
 
 
Empowered by this experience, Devon Ash decided to co-found Social Fluency, a training company that focuses on drills and real world exercises to teach positive, life-changing social habits through unique teaching techniques and skills-based approach. Armed with proven results and cutting edge brain-changing technologies, Social Fluency is guaranteed to change your life, personally, professionally and with powerful results! Startup Finance: Valuation
 


Learn how to value startups in this 2 hour class.
Valuation can make or break a company. As investors, entrepreneurs, employees and consultants it is very critical to understand the value of the startups we associate ourselves with.

There are many circumstances in which valuation is critical:
A. You are looking to raise funding for your company.
B. You are looking to invest in a startup.
C. You are looking to work for a startup and your success is tied to the startup’s success.
D. You are about to get paid in equity.
E. You are interested in selling your business.
 
Valuation is the key component that enables the sales and purchase activity of startups. It is the very component that enabled Insagram’s sale for $1 Billion and Facebooks valuation of $100 Billion (approximately). 
This class is purely focused on startup valuation with entrepreneurial and non-public valuation needs in mind. We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation strictly from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.
~~~
This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.  Attendees can expect to walk through a few financial examples of valuations. The valuation focus is strictly startups and all the exercise examples are based on startup models.
 
Why: Here are some recent valuation news items that reflect the importance of valuation.
 
- Instagram sells for $1 billion
- Palo Alto-based TIBCO Software buys LogLogic for $130M
- Redwood Shores-based Oracle acquires Taleo for $1.9 billion
- Hyperion Therapeutics has filed for an IPO with a goal to raise $57.5 M
- 41st Parameter raised $13M in a Series D funding
- Viadeo raised $32M in funding for its professional networking service

It&#39;s for all levels, meaning that if you&#39;ve never practiced PhysioEmoDynamics or you&#39;re an experienced practitioner, you&#39;ll feel at home, challenged, and at ease. During the weekend (2 classes, 2 hours each) you will experientially learn how to achieve immediate results for unnecessary pain, suffering, and illness – any time it occurs. Together we will quickly access and heal the root causes for Physical, Mental, and Emotional Suffering or each attendee.
The PhysioEmoDynamics System employs intuitive, compassionate touch and kinesthetic modalities to create a pleasant sensory experience during each class.
The transcendental character of the music is carefully selected to assist attendees in experiencing a collective state of bodily transcendence, similar to that of ancient shamanic dancing ritual, trough hypnotic, pulsing melodies and rhythms... all to design the environment of joy and unification with each other in Love, while your body moves. During each class of PhysioEmoDynamics there are three major steps in the process of permanently releasing the stored tension and energetic blockages:

Identification,
Liberation,
Integration.

By giving proper attention to the body and to the senses, the session proceeds smoothly and efficiently. PhysioEmoDynamics uses a blend of physical, emotional, energetic, and cognitive healing techniques to intuitively and rapidly resolve the root cause of pain, suffering, and illness. The PhysioEmoDynamics System does this by activating and enhancing your own mind’s natural self-healing abilities to untangle self-defeating neural clusters and re-architect your mental structures so that you become the ~you~ you have always known you can be. And you ~can~ be that you sooner than you expect - it will take just 2 dyas of dancing breathing and mindfully working with your body.

Learn how to value startups in this 2 hour class.
Valuation can make or break a company. As investors, entrepreneurs, employees and consultants it is very critical to understand the value of the startups we associate ourselves with.

There are many circumstances in which valuation is critical:
A. You are looking to raise funding for your company.
B. You are looking to invest in a startup.
C. You are looking to work for a startup and your success is tied to the startup’s success.
D. You are about to get paid in equity.
E. You are interested in selling your business.
 
Valuation is the key component that enables the sales and purchase activity of startups. It is the very component that enabled Insagram’s sale for $1 Billion and Facebooks valuation of $100 Billion (approximately). 
This class is purely focused on startup valuation with entrepreneurial and non-public valuation needs in mind. We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation strictly from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.
~~~
This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.  Attendees can expect to walk through a few financial examples of valuations. The valuation focus is strictly startups and all the exercise examples are based on startup models.
 
Why: Here are some recent valuation news items that reflect the importance of valuation.
 
- Instagram sells for $1 billion
- Palo Alto-based TIBCO Software buys LogLogic for $130M
- Redwood Shores-based Oracle acquires Taleo for $1.9 billion

  Startup Finance: Valuation
 


Learn how to value startups in this 2 hour class.
Valuation can make or break a company. As investors, entrepreneurs, employees and consultants it is very critical to understand the value of the startups we associate ourselves with.

There are many circumstances in which valuation is critical:
A. You are looking to raise funding for your company.
B. You are looking to invest in a startup.
C. You are looking to work for a startup and your success is tied to the startup’s success.
D. You are about to get paid in equity.
E. You are interested in selling your business.
 
Valuation is the key component that enables the sales and purchase activity of startups. It is the very component that enabled Insagram’s sale for $1 Billion and Facebooks valuation of $100 Billion (approximately). 
This class is purely focused on startup valuation with entrepreneurial and non-public valuation needs in mind. We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation strictly from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.
~~~
This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.  Attendees can expect to walk through a few financial examples of valuations. The valuation focus is strictly startups and all the exercise examples are based on startup models.
 
Why: Here are some recent valuation news items that reflect the importance of valuation.
 
- Instagram sells for $1 billion
- Palo Alto-based TIBCO Software buys LogLogic for $130M
- Redwood Shores-based Oracle acquires Taleo for $1.9 billion

Cheera Biryani (snack/appetizer)


White Chicken Korma


Saag Paneer


As you walk into the class, you’ll be greeted with some hot chai.

We begin the class by making a Cheera Biryani; it is a North East Indian snack item made from dried flattened rice with spices and other goodness. After we are done polishing off the Cheera Biryani, we’ll cook a White Chicken Korma from scratch. Contrary to the chicken curries you might be familiar with that have a yellow or red base, this one will have a white, thick gravy. Along with that, we’ll also prepare Saag Paneer - spinach and paneer cooked with spices. We’ll cook this dish using fresh spinach and paneer – the outcome is unbelievably delicious and refreshing. This gourmet meal is complete with some plain rice on the side. 

Address to the class will be provided after registration.

Menu subject to ingredient availability in the market. In the rare occasion that something isn’t available, it’ll be replaced with something very similar. You’ll be notified of any change.

 With a background in theater and stand-up comedy, Kellye Gray has developed a technique to help students connect with the creative mind that allows them to improvise, compose and perform on the spot. Singers work with Kellye on various exercises that help to keep the “editor of the mind” in check. In the second half of the workshop, an accompanist joins the class. Interacting with a pianist and with the other students in the workshop, vocalists discover how to create freely and with confidence. The atmosphere of “play” is serious work that translates into results. According to Ms. Gray: “Students learn how to listen, invent, evolve and improvise. They create completely improvised compositions as a solo artist, a duet and even a trio.”
Professionally trained at the Actors Studio, the Comedy Workshop, BA from Southwest Texas State, private studies in technique; Adjunct faculty Austin School of Music, clinician, national and international touring jazz artist, multiple Addy awards, recording artist, producer,

Welcome! If you want to learn about a different approach to health and wellness, you’ve come to the right place! 
Sweeping generalized recommendations out there do not work for everyone. You are unique, so should be your wellness plan. Come discover:
*  what makes you unique
*  how does time of day, time of year, and your age effect your wellness
*  what is Ayurveda medical science
*  how does Aryurveda medical science 
*  how can health care reform help you
Rakesh Sethi, Wellness Speaker, Author, and Practititoner will offer an eye opening presentation on Ayurveda medical science, a health-management approach that encourages wellness, rather than a disease-management approach that treats illness.

These fun and engaging classes explore yoga poses, cooperative games, and breathing exercises. Lessons in self-expression, body-awareness, social skills, and relaxation techniques are also conveyed. Non-competitive and fun, these classes help kids build and develop strength, flexibility, concentration and confidence.
This class will be run every Sunday starting July 22 through August 26. 
Theme for July: Stress reduction for deeper connections at home and at work.
Even though we&#39;ve spent a lot of money on retreats and therapists looking for inner happiness, we still wonder why we aren&#39;t feeling better about our lives. While we were able to change the world, being at peace with ourselves wasn&#39;t as easy. What if the key to life&#39;s richness was already inside of you, and so was a life filled with transformation and change? What if long lasting change meant: Making peace with yourself, and learning to accept your body as it is now. Having the courage to meet new people, and enjoying more positive relationships. Having longer periods of peace and calm. 
Andrea&#39;s comprehensive approach to healing will help you create a new lifestyle! Come join Andrea Johnson, a spiritual devotee and transformation coach, to learn more about these powerful steps to change and transformation! $65 per person/per day or $300 per week

I am truly grateful for this life-changing program. I am truly blessed and prosperous from having taken it. I most highly recommend it to anyone seeking prosperity.        J.C., 4T student

Workforce Development / Economic Opportunity:  Examples include job placement efforts, adult education, occupational training, training for English language learners, career counseling.
Health and Wellness:  Examples include cooking and nutritional meal planning classes for Women, Infants, and Children recipients; programs that support nutrition and active lifestyles; educating people of all ages about their health, as well as preventing and managing chronic diseases and obesity; fitness programs promoting healthy and active lifestyles, including those specifically reducing health risks and obesity.

Sources may or may not have a limit that you can apply for, although grants are generally from $5,000, $10,000, $25,000 and up, and are fully tied to your project or program budget.
When you complete the workshop, you could have a complete grant request. If anything needs to be added to your grant request, you&#39;ve identified that information (financials, budget, etc.), and you will know exactly where it gets inserted to complete the funding request. You also know how to make the submission (via mail, email, or online submission).
If you thought grant writing was something you couldn&#39;t do, this will change your mind!
 
Plan for your next funding opportunity by completing this work and being prepared to submit your grant application!

REGISTER NOW:    http://08152012grantwritingworkshop.eventbrite.comAre you tired of having back or joint pain? You can learn how to be free of pain! Learning what is the underlying cause of your pain will enable you to make changes that eliminate your pain. Almost everyone in highly industrialized countries has adopted a modern posture that is misaligned and so pervasive we can&#39;t even see it. Many treatments don&#39;t address the underlying cause of pain.  Learning a set of simple, specific guidelines can bring you relief from pain anytime, anywhere. The same guidelines that take away your pain also straighten your spine.  Come to a 2 hour Balance Method workshop - &#34;The 3 Myths That are Causing Your Back Pain&#34;. Mention where you heard about this for your complimentary ticket!  IN PETALUMA: Wednesday, August 15 from 9:30-11:30 am.  RESERVATIONS ARE REQUIRED. Seating is limited. To register, call 707-658-2599 or visit www.sonomabodybalance.com  Why do people in some countries have no back pain? 80% of the population in the United States suffers from back pain, compared to only 5% in many other countries, such as Portugal and Greece. These healthy people move slightly differently than we do. The teaching of the Balance Center is based on more than 35 years of research on these healthy populations. When you stand, bend, sit, walk, and sleep as these people do, your pain can be significantly reduced or eliminated.  SIX WAYS THIS APPROACH IS UNIQUE:  -Balance is based on studying healthy people -No special devices, special equipment or special chairs are needed -No exercises or radical positions are required -Balance dramatically improves your posture -You use this information immediately in your car, at work, even at the movies -A slight shift in position brings relief   WHAT DO PEOPLE SAY ABOUT THE RESULTS OF BALANCE?  “I have successfully used Balance Center instructions as part of a comprehensive treatment program for my patients with painful spinal conditions.” - William Firtch, M.D.  &#34;This class was a revelation for me. It increased my awareness of being out of Balance and I learned simple changes I can make to become more balanced and pain free. It was powerful learning what I can do on a daily basis to avoid pain. Dana taught us simple techniques to use everyday to correct bad posture and live pain free. It’s given me hope and has been a life changing experience that has put me back in control .&#34; - Julie Shapiro, Oakland, CA  &#34;Before I took the Balance class, I experienced chronic neck, low back, hip, and gluteal tension, in spite of the fact that I received weekly chiropractic adjustments. While taking the class, my tension decreased significantly. The tools I learned in the class also enabled me to teach basic sitting skills to patients which helped eliminate a major cause of recurring back pain for many of them.&#34; -Jay Bunker, Chiropractor  Taught by Dana Davis, MA, Senior Certified Instructor by the Balance Center in Palo Alto and Certified Yoga Teacher. Class includes slides, practice sitting and bending in Balance, anatomy and individual hands-on guidance. Enrollment is limited. For more information, visit www.sonomabodybalance.com.

Learn how to value startups in this 2 hour class.
Valuation can make or break a company. As investors, entrepreneurs, employees and consultants it is very critical to understand the value of the startups we associate ourselves with.

Subscribe to our mailing listThis class explores the creation of the script. Work will focus on releasing creativity, exploring themes, and creating stage worthy work. Pan’s playwriting classes are taught by local playwrights. They focus on creating a safe space that will give the beginner the freedom to explore and experienced playwrights the opportunity to hone their skills.  Each playwright will get a staged reading of their favorite work created during the course. Class members will get the opportunity to choose as a group the four best pieces created (and that can easily be staged at Pan). These works will be produced at Pan with actors from Pan’s performing troupes.  The class will focus on the ten minute play format. For production purposes plays with smaller casts and less elaborate staging will be required if you wish to have it considered for production at Pan.  Each piece chosen for full production at Pan will receive a production stipend of $50 for a single performance.   This is our first playwriting class and dovetails with our second annual ten minute play festival: Anything Can Happen Ten Minutes.  Class size is limited. We suggest registering early.
 
NOTE: While this event is based in Northern California, it is only open for attendees outside of Northern California.

 14 Black Poppies&#39; Guiding Proverb:
Artistry is a unique combustion of talent, observance, mastery, repetition and luck.
14 Black Poppies goes on a field trip to Ocean Beach for a bonfire! Participants are encouraged to bring burnable objects and scour the beach for driftwood to create a mini-burning man. This catchy workshop will show you how quickly art catches fire.

More about the Workshops:
Each workshop is rooted in one of 14 Black Poppies&#39; 14 Proverbs. The 14 Proverbs, written by Jason Wyman and Margaret Bacon Schulze, exemplify 14 Black Poppies values: process, interdependence, space, movement, release, harmony, renewal, beauty, time, impermanence, artistry, discovery, repetition, and wisdom. Each workshop explores the guiding proverb/value through diverse practices and experiences including (but not limited to) writing, meditation, movement, theater games, visual art, inquiry, and more. By connecting generations, cultures, and experiences in a physical space, the workshops aim to democratize arts, wellness, and community practices and empower the participants to find new and innovative ways to bring arts, wellness, and community into their lives and communities.
About the Co-Founders/Facilitators:
 Drawing on over 20 plus years in education, writing, theater, healing arts, youth development, social justice, event planning and strategic thinking, Jason Wyman and Margaret Bacon Schulze know how to build and sustain intentional community, unearth and cultivate hidden talents, formulate thought-provoking questions and explore possible answers/solutions/new directions. Their unique dynamic bridges generations, cultures and styles to bring out the best in people, situations and communities. They met each other through the Japanese Community Youth Center 13 years ago and have cultivated a tremendous friendship that blossomed into 14 Black Poppies. Introduction To Beekeeping

  Startup Finance: Valuation
 


Learn how to value startups in this 2 hour class.
Valuation can make or break a company. As investors, entrepreneurs, employees and consultants it is very critical to understand the value of the startups we associate ourselves with.

There are many circumstances in which valuation is critical:
A. You are looking to raise funding for your company.
B. You are looking to invest in a startup.
C. You are looking to work for a startup and your success is tied to the startup’s success.
D. You are about to get paid in equity.
E. You are interested in selling your business.
 
Valuation is the key component that enables the sales and purchase activity of startups. It is the very component that enabled Insagram’s sale for $1 Billion and Facebooks valuation of $100 Billion (approximately). 
This class is purely focused on startup valuation with entrepreneurial and non-public valuation needs in mind. We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation strictly from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.
~~~
This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.  Attendees can expect to walk through a few financial examples of valuations. The valuation focus is strictly startups and all the exercise examples are based on startup models.
 
Why: Here are some recent valuation news items that reflect the importance of valuation.

Workshop Cost: $199.00Subtle Listening is a mode of listening where one&#39;s imagination is open to the sound world around them, helping their inner ear and outer world intersect. The Subtle Listening workshop is an ongoing workshop for musicians, media artists, filmmakers, composers, producers, sound designers, or any type of artist who wants to sharpen their listening skills. The workshop uses a wide range of techniques culled from Jungian psychology, Hermetic philosophy, paradox and Buddhist mediation, as well as thirty years of my own experience as a sound artist and electro-acoustic music composer. Through guided meditation, and various types of listening exercises, participants will learn techniques they can use any time to help heighten their sensitivity to the sounds around them.
As a courtesy to the workshop participants it would be appreciated if everyone arrived at the studio at 11AM sharp.

Learn how to value startups in this 2 hour class.
Valuation can make or break a company. As investors, entrepreneurs, employees and consultants it is very critical to understand the value of the startups we associate ourselves with.

There are many circumstances in which valuation is critical:
A. You are looking to raise funding for your company.
B. You are looking to invest in a startup.
C. You are looking to work for a startup and your success is tied to the startup’s success.
D. You are about to get paid in equity.
E. You are interested in selling your business.
 
Valuation is the key component that enables the sales and purchase activity of startups. It is the very component that enabled Insagram’s sale for $1 Billion and Facebooks valuation of $100 Billion (approximately). 
This class is purely focused on startup valuation with entrepreneurial and non-public valuation needs in mind. We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation strictly from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.
~~~
This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.  Attendees can expect to walk through a few financial examples of valuations. The valuation focus is strictly startups and all the exercise examples are based on startup models.
 
Why: Here are some recent valuation news items that reflect the importance of valuation.
 
- Instagram sells for $1 billion
- Palo Alto-based TIBCO Software buys LogLogic for $130M
- Redwood Shores-based Oracle acquires Taleo for $1.9 billion
- Hyperion Therapeutics has filed for an IPO with a goal to raise $57.5 M

Remember that Cosmo magazine article that talked about how Tantra and breathing could give you explosive orgasms? How about the urban legend about Sting having sex for eight hour stints? Regardless of your tolerance for words like &#34;chakras&#34; and &#34;yoni,&#34; there is a non New Agey way to understanding and incorporating ecstatic experiences into your bedroom routine that is fun, easy, and explosive. If you or a lover have ever experienced post-orgasmic spasms or &#34;twitches&#34; after lovemaking, or feelings of heat and tension in your lower back, hands, neck or throat... You might be more energetic in your sex life than you think! And if you&#39;ve never experienced those things but would like to, you might be pleasantly surprised how easily energetic sex is to grasp and play with.
Join sex and relationship expert Reid Mihalko of ReidAboutSex.com for an evening of frank, fun, and electrifying learning targeted for folks who aren&#39;t New Agey. Reid promises to drop the woo-woo and leave his Sandskrit-to-English dictionary at home! And, for those of you who say Namasté instead of &#34;thank you,&#34; Reid&#39;s got you covered, too!
You will be introduced to:

Reid&#39;s particular views on how sexual energy &#34;behaves&#34; and how it “works,” as well as ways you can begin accessing more energetic awareness in the bedroom
What Kriyas (&#34;the twitchys&#34;) can look like and what to do when you or a lover experiences them
Three possible approaches for engaging sexual energy and expanding it when exploring energetic sex with a partner or solo with yourself
What playing a singing saw has to do with energetic sex and expanding your lovemaking
Simple breathing and &#34;presence&#34; techniques to build up energetic awareness
How to use &#34;pressure play&#34; and where so you can help unlock and activate points on your lover&#39;s body to augment energetic experiences during love making
A few advance tips and tricks that will make you smile and your partner moan regardless of whether &#34;the twitchys&#34; happen or not!

Whatever your level of experience with sex that seems to be &#34;more than just sex,&#34; Reid&#39;s humorous and informative instruction, sex education, and live demonstrations on this esoteric (and yet more common than you think) realm of energetic sex is not to be missed!  Date: Wednesday, June 13th, 2012 Time: 6:00-8:00pm Location: Good Vibrations, the Polk Street store 1620 Polk Street (at Sacramento Street) San Francisco, CA 94109 Cost: $20 in advance, $25 at the door Tickets: Get &#39;em HERE, or go to the GoodVibes site HERE

Dear Friends,
I would like to introduce you to an opportunity that will add value to you, your team, your customers and to your organization.
It is a one-day roll up your sleeves Business and Leadership Development Summit designed to improve earnings, cash flow and productivity.
Please take a few minutes to read the details of my offering.
Welcome to Twelve O’clock High:
My approach is to develop the complete person as a leader. It is those leaders, across all positions in your company who are equipped to contribute directly to the bottom line.
Participants in the process I lead are the individuals that want to:

Become better decision-makers, able to see and execute opportunities for adding value
Develop consistent, customer-focused relationships throughout your organization
Lead teamwork that ensures a superior experience for shareholders, customers, and prospects
Generate critical new service and product offerings to add value in tough markets 
Accelerate earnings growth in existing and new geographic markets 
Create customers for life who rely on you and your organization for all their business solutions
Streamline the efforts of people and processes across all positions
Ensure profit-driven activity toward daily, weekly, quarterly, and annual goals 
Generate, track, and report these and related achievements on a 30-day results cycle






 
 
Let’s Look at the Process   PHASE ONE
TWELVE O&#39;CLOCK HIGH
At this innovative, one-day event, participants quickly see what&#39;s working (and not working) on the front lines of their companies ... and in their own leadership styles. Each participant gets personal, hands-on analysis and feedback, plus the same tools and action plans I have used to help companies transform themselves from the inside out worldwide. This one-day process creates a kind of instant transparency for anyone running a company, team, region, or project. It clears the way to seeing what works and doing it.
 
Twelve O&#39;Clock Highis a world renowned movie classic. It&#39;s also recognized as one of the most powerful business learning tools available. As a way to identify and solve daily operational issues that may be keeping you from moving ahead faster, it is a virtual giant. Throughout the day, I guide participants through key scenes where they see dozens of communication, planning, delegation, accountability, and productivity issues played out—the good, the bad, and the unprofitable. They see where they can improve, then set goals and create a 30-day action plan for doing so. This is not training, which is usually separate from doing. In any process I lead, effort must equal results in real time. We get things done by doing them. 
  
This customized Twelve O’Clock High process includes pre-workshop  SWOT analysis, the workshop itself, and follow-up coaching and support.

They see where they can improve, then set goals and create a 30-day action plan for doing so. This is not training, which is usually separate from doing. In any process I lead, effort must equal results in real time. We get things done by doing them. 
 
This customized Twelve O’Clock High process includes pre-workshop  SWOT analysis, the workshop itself, and follow-up coaching and support. 

 STEP ONE  Pre-Workshop SWOT Analysis
 
The first step in this customized Twelve O’Clock High process is a pre-workshop SWOT analysis and DISC report. 
SWOT Analysis: The SWOT analysis provides a look at an organization as a whole. It evaluates the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT).  All participants complete a SWOT analysis of self and the organization. These reports are strictly for my use in planning how to address individual and organizational needs. In addition, all participants will complete an individual SWOT analysis at the one-day event. With this report I will be able to work with each participant on an individual level as it impacts their role at and contribution to the organization. Addressing both larger organizational issues at a company as well as individual activities, behaviors, and beliefs, and then merging them into a cohesive development plan, is a key factor in the process I lead and the results it produces. 
DISC Report: The DISC report is an individual behavioral analysis. It is conducted by having each participant complete a brief, online survey.Each participant will receive their own DISC report at the workshop and use it as a tool throughout the day and in their daily operations back on the job. The DISC report not only defines each participant’s behavioral profile, but shows them how to leverage that behavior for success. It can also be used to hire the right person, get employees off to a fast start, revitalize current employees, improve communication, increase productivity, build morale, and ensure sound employee-manager and team relationships. I use this tool throughout my coaching to help participants maximize their own strengths and contribute to organizational goals.
  STEP TWO  One-Day Workshop 
Our day begins by quickly moving participants to a new level of personal awareness and accountability. They get clarity about what makes them tick—personally and professionally—and the impact of that on their positions, teams, customers, and their company. They learn how to make the following leadership components part of who they are and how they operate. These components include but are not limited to the following:
·   Decision Making
·   Goal Setting
·   Planning
·   Setting Priorities 
·   Critical Thinking
·   Accountability
·   Communication 
·   Delegation
·   Team Work
·   Time Management
·   Crisis Management
·   Leadership By Example 
&#34;There are no theories here. I show you what works and how to make it work for them.&#34;
 The leadership components above are the foundation for drilling down to focus on specific skill sets—the management areas critical for participant and the organization. Throughout the one-day workshop and follow-up coaching, participants gain an integrated command of these skills in real time within their individual positions and areas of responsibility. Here is a sample of the components we will cover:
·       Strategic Account, Territory and Project Management
·       Financial Planning 
·       Contract Negotiation
·       Balancing Assets and Debt
·       Market Penetration
·       Behavioral Selling
·       Creating a pipeline of business in a down economy
·       Marketing and PR Through Strategic Channels
·       Right Job, Right Person, Right Time  
 STEP THREE  Follow-Up Coaching and Support
It is critical that you achieve measurable results from any process or event in which your people engage. Those results and the accountability for achieving them are accomplished through follow-up. Because each participant leaves the workshop with specific goals and a 30-day action plan, accountability toward those goals is an important component of both the group and individual coaching sessions. I will begin the 30 days of group coaching and support 5 days after the Twelve O’Clock High workshop. Individual coaching by email will begin immediately following the workshop.
 The 30 Days of Follow-Up Includes:
 
·      Group webinars, webcasts, and teleseminar Q&amp;A’s, which give your participants opportunities for feedback, questions, and guidance. We also determine the progress (or lack of progress) they are making toward their goals. I help them make any needed adjustments to keep them moving forward. 
·      The online and teleseminar formats ensure that participants maintain a high level of job productivity while engaged in this coaching process.
·      Individual coaching by email, which ensures that participants get real-time help when they need it as questions, issues, and situations arise.  It is available throughout the 60 days on an as-needed basis, starting immediately following the event.
·      Participants receive a schedule of follow-up sessions before leaving the event.                



 




 





Logistics
The Twelve O’Clock High workshop will be held at the Hayes Mansion in San Jose, California. The workshop will start at 8:00 am with check in at 7:30 am and adjourn at 6:00 pm. This expanded time frame is part of the customized process. It ensures that participants accomplish more right at the event. The first follow-up session is scheduled at the event. These online and teleseminar group sessions will then be held every week for the remainder of the 30 days. Individual coaching by email will begin immediately following the event. 
 
Twelve O’Clock High environment—a roll-up-your-sleeves level of participation, dialogue, and doing. It also gives me time to work with each participant individually as they use their SWOT analysis, DISC reports, and other tools to set goals and create their 30-day action plans.

 To artist or non-artist, the creative process often seems mysterious and magical. How do we give a physical reality to our inspiration so that it communicates its essential nature? Shambhala Art’s purpose is to explore the creative process and the product we call art, from the viewpoint of a meditative discipline. It is a viewpoint that encourages us to see things as they are, rather than just how we think or imagine them to be.
The Shambhala Art Path shows how all human beings can be creative. It provides participants with tools to discover how daily life is a source of inspiration. It is about the joy of expressing ourselves and experience in small groups the richness and uniqueness of each human being. It is about art in everyday life. 
Shambhala Art does not teach a particular skill or technique such as painting, sculpture, or dance. It is about the source of inspiration, its manifestation, and how it speaks to us beyond the limits of its container. Once a view and a path are established it can be put into practice within any artistic discipline. Although the Shambhala Art teachings are inspired by Shambhala Buddhism, they are not in any way religious or about adopting a religion. They are about discovery and play, and the universal nature of creativity and communication.
Shambhala Art is also an international non-profit arts education program based on the Dharma Art teachings of the late Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, the founder of Shambhala Buddhism, Shambhala International, and Naropa Institute. He was an artist, poet, and author of over a dozen books on subjects ranging from psychology to iconography.

Kate Davila katedavila@yahoo.comInterested in taking your cycling to the next level with clip-in pedals?  Whether you ride a road bike, mountain bike or commuter bike, clip-in pedals will help you to ride more efficiently, produce more power, especially when ascending the local hills, and be more confident in your handling by being more &#39;connected&#39; to your bike.  The rigid connection allows you to engage a better control of balance.  Imagine utilizing the power from your legs as they move up, pulling the pedal, as well as when you push down on the pedals.  Pulling up with your opposite leg while the other is pushing down creates a better distribution of the workload across both legs simultaneously.   
Ready to join us for this free clinic providing you with the tips and tricks to quickly learn how to use your clip-in pedals and how to easily and safety unclip at intersections, stop signs and refueling stops?  Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll need to do to prepare for the clinic and what you&#39;ll need to bring along to get the most out of it:
1) If you don&#39;t already own a pair of clip-in specific cycling shoes, stop by Sports Basement several days in advance to try some on, ask questions of our knowledgeable cycling staff and make your purchase so you may bring them to the clinic.  Doing this in advance will also provide enough time for your size to be located should it not be available that day.
2) Take a look at the clip-in pedal selection and discuss your options and what is recommended for your type of riding.  Purchase them if you&#39;re ready or wait for the clinic when we&#39;ll discuss your options and the comparative benefits.  If you have purchased pedals, we&#39;ll put them on your bike (if not already installed) and proceed to the parking lot to practice clipping in and out, starting and stopping and feeling comfortable and confident while riding this &#39;connected&#39; to your bike.
Bring the following gear:
- your bike
- cycling gear (helmet, riding apparel, cycling shoes and clip-in pedals)

&#34;I was extremely impressed by &amp; with your seminar.  I appreciated the feedback given to all the speakers.  I liked the practical aspect. Thanks for a great day!&#34;
~ Carolyn &#34;CJ&#34; Jones, Award-Winning Author ~
===============oOo===============
&#34;This was a fantastic introduction to some of the core tools and techniques for presenters.  Great stuff!&#34;

&#34;This 1-day workshop was more than I expected. Susan &amp; Jenny give a LOT!&#34;
~ Matthew Chapman, Feng Shui Consultant ~
===============oOo===============
&#34;The information provided was outstanding! ... &#34;
~ Chris Buna ~
 ===============oOo===============
&#34;Jenny Campbell was a godsend for me in stepping in at the last hour
before the most important day of my event and coaching me to deliver a highly successful offer. If it were not for Jenny&#39;s expertise and winning strategy, I could have lost the trust and rapport I so delicately built with my audience. I will be working with Jenny to strategize on all my future events to ensure a successful outcome every time. I highly recommend you include Jenny as a vital addition to your event team.&#34; 
~ Michelle Van Otten, Business Image Expert ~
===============oOo===============
“Susan helped me totally ROCK the 3-day retreat I just led. We had 8 hours coaching in advance and honestly, I could not have done it without her. She helped plan every section and listened to me and gave me so many valuable tips I would never have thought of. You know those little places where you feel uncomfortable where you say something?  Susan picked up on that and found a genuine heartfelt way to say what needed to be said, but to say it in a way that felt so much more welcoming and honoring of my people. It’s who I really WANT to be, but couldn&#39;t figure out how to get to. 6 out of 19 women signed up for my $1,197 offer! I made over $7100! THANK YOU SUSAN! And I can’t wait for your seminar next Saturday. How do I register?”
~ Laura Cornell, Yoga Teacher Mentor~
===============oOo===============
 “Jenny Campbell is one of my favorite speakers and trainers. She is so passionate and excited about what she teaches and how it benefits others that her energy becomes contagious! She’s focused, knows what she’s conveying and speaks it with purpose and clarity. I learn so much from her. I would attend any training or speaking presentation she is leading without hesitation and endorse her fully!” 
~ Kathryn K Strong, Business Owner ~
===============oOo===============
 &#34;I came to Susan the night before I gave my first technical lecture. I felt stiff and unsure, but had no idea how to improve. In one energetic fun session, Susan transformed my dry lecture-style delivery into an authentically engaging presence that activated the audience - my talk rocked!  She&#39;s the perfect “wingman” to have my back and help my future speaking soar. I especially appreciated how in our first phone conversation she shared two tips that really helped my preparation. And how she took the time to hear my goals in speaking and to understand my audience. In person, she offered overall strategies and specific suggestions that I was able to apply to my entire presentation. Through the whole process I felt inspired, supported and empowered. I could not recommend Susan Kerby more highly as your coach to make your talk rock!&#34;
~ Craig Harris, CMT, Hendrickson Method® Therapist ~
===============oOo===============
&#34;Jenny was absolutely riveting and knowledgeable about the mechanics and techniques of speaking on stage. If I was to bring someone in to speak to my sales team, it would be her.&#34;~ Shelley Lamar Albert, Online Marketer &amp; Social Media Expert ~
===============oOo===============
&#34;I had my first VIP day with Susan Kerby today. It was really fun andrevealing! I went to her to help me get my message strong when doing teleseminars and workshops. But what came out of our session was far more than coaching me about speaking. She acted as a mirror for me to use my own stuff; my techniques and coaching to figure out who I was meant to reach. And this revealed that the community of entrepreneurs we both met in was my target, and then we began crafting my positioningand honing my message.I can&#39;t thank Susan enough for turning my ideas into a real action plan. And she will be there when I do my first seminar, coaching me all the way!&#34;

In this course, participants will learn how to use the ggplot R Project to make, format, label and adjust graphs using R. The ggplot2 Project, created by Hadley Wickham, is named after the term &#34;Grammar of Graphics,&#34; which was coined by Leland Wilkinson (creator of Systat). This &#34;grammar of graphics&#34; is a system of describing and organizing the fundamental components of a graph and the process of creating a graph. Using ggplot2, participants will learn how to design and implement graphs in an efficient, elegant and systematic manner, following principles of general good graphing practice.
Prerequisite:

SESSION 2: Graphics for large data

Histograms and bar charts for displaying distributional summaries 
Boxplots 
Other techniques for overcoming overplotting with drawing scatterplots of large datasets

Description:
Get the insight into Mobile Application Development with this 2 day it training course. The class is from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM each day.

Following lunch we start out with jQuery Mobile (sometimes covered before lunch) followed by integration of PhoneGap with jQuery Mobile and Sencha Touch. The next topic covered is event handling; we cover the event handling mechanism. This leads into working with device, network and notifications. A key topic covered on day 1 is the Camera API which concludes the training for day1.
Day 2 begins with fresh coffee at 9:00 AM. With a continuation to Camera API the topics covered next is Audio, Video and Image Capture. Attendees usually have several questions around this topic so extended time is given to these topics. Following this we cover some of the most important APIs that include: Media, Storage and File System API, GeoLocation API, Compass and Acclerometer API. Lunch is served in between one of the topics. Following the APIs we cover how to develop PhoneGap PlugIns and how to generate Android and iOS builds from HTML5 Code. This concludes the 2 day it training course.

 This WIMP Workshop is day two out of three days over three weeks and will cover WordPress and WordPress Theme Development. Each workshop is estimated to run for about 4 hours. A laptop or a hefty note book is required as we&#39;ll be learning how to install local servers such as MAMP or WAMP on our laptops and going through the process together to produce a website in all classes.
 
Presenter: Cole Geissinger

Beginning Theme Development assumes you have a decent grasp or understanding of HTML/CSS. If you understand the basics of programming this will come in handy, but is not required, as we will be giving some basic introductions to common programming techniques in PHP. You are not required to understand PHP or know it, but again, a basic understand will go a long ways.
Side note - since this class is about building WordPress themes, we won&#39;t focus so much on the design aspect. In reality, if you can build it in HTML/CSS, you can build it in WordPress. The question isn&#39;t, &#34;can WordPress handle this design?&#34;, it&#39;s more of - &#34;can we build this in HTML/CSS?&#34;.
In this class we&#39;ll be taking an existing design template and bringing it into WordPress. Once it&#39;s in WordPress, we&#39;ll prep it up to go live in our local environment. The final result will be a working WordPress theme that you are free to use as a starter theme for any future projects.

Hand-pulled mozzarella  Do you ever wonder what exactly &#34;hand-pulled&#34; mozzarella is?  Do you want to know why that ball of burrata at specialty shops is $15? Come learn what the fuss is all about, and see how delicious fresh mozzarella can be!   Sharon Ardiana, the chef and owner of Gialina and Ragazza Pizzerias will lead this 2 hour, hands-on class, all about fresh mozzarella. In this workshop we’ll learn the art of pulling fresh mozzarella- the delicate texture will be utterly different than the lumps of plastic-sealed pizza mozzarella you buy at grocery stores. This class will focus on the process of &#34;pasta filata&#34; -- we will start with fresh cow&#39;s milk curds, which will be heated and stretched by hand. Note: Making the curds from scratch is a difficult chemistry experiment, and it can be frustrating for the most seasoned chef.   At the end of the workshop, you will have stretched several balls of mozzarella to take home, and you&#39;ll have a better understanding and appreciation for this Italian classic.   Please bring your own reusable container to take home mozzarella. 
About the instructor:
 Chef Sharon Ardiana is the chef/owner of 2 San Francisco restaurants- Gialina and Ragazza.  Both are pizza-centric and included in the 2012 SF Chronicle Top 100 Restaurants.  Her menus are seasonal and farm driven. Sharon has 30 years of professional cooking experience at San Francisco&#39;s top restaurants including Slow Club, Boulevard, Sol y Luna, Garibaldis, Lime and Last Supper Club. In 2007 Sharon opened Gialina in Glen Park, followed by Ragazza in 2010.

Cheese Basics: History, lactose and tasting
Join Sophie Mosgrove, Manager and resident cheesemonger at Salumeria, for an afternoon full of lactose! This workshop will include a brief cheese history, cheese vocabulary, a discussion of the basic differences between cheese types, from soft to hard, cow and beyond. And yes! There will be tasting involved. Sophie will talk about how to create the perfect cheese plate, explaining how to pick sure-shot winners and the appropriate accoutrements. 
About the instructor:
Growing up in the Bay Area, Sophie has always had a taste for cheese. Her appreciation began at the ripe age of 5, asking for brie and baguette sandwiches for lunch but it wasn&#39;t until she returned to San Francisco after college that the passion truly flourished. Gaining experience at some of California&#39;s most notable cheese counters, Sophie has evolved her love of lactose into the ultimate dream job.

How to shoot in Manual – a workshop on the basics of photography
Do you ever take photos you love but not know how to recreate them? Or get frustrated trying to shoot in low light conditions? Most answers to your photographic troubles can be found in two very basic principles: f-stop and shutter speed. How to shoot in manual is a crash course on just that – understanding how your camera records light. Take this workshop if you want to elevate your status from point-and-click to shooting in manual and owning it. It’s much simpler than you think!
Digital SLR camera highly recommended, as we will have a hands-on shooting session in the neighborhood after the in-class discussion. 
About the instructor:
Margo Moritz is a native Californian who started in the south and made her way up the coast until landing in San Francisco 6 years ago. She still feels like a wizard every time she loads a roll of 35mm into her Bessa rangefinder. When she’s not feeding her urge to travel, she can be found riding around on her scooter, practicing her headstand, and discovering a new favorite way to cook an egg. Margo has her MFA in photography and her list of clients include local magazines, small businesses, dance companies, and brides to be. Her work can be seen at www.margomoritz.com and http://www.thebolditalic.com/bold-locals/margomoritz.

Basic Bicycle Mechanics and Maintenance by Dave Nelson of PUBLIC Bikes This workshop will focus on the basic form, function and diagnostics of bicycles.  In the first hour PUBLIC employee Dave Nelson will give a broad overview of basic mechanics and maintenance. The purpose of this clinic is to help you understand how your gearing works, how to change a flat, best ways to lock your bike, and basic troubleshooting of brakes, chain and shifters.   After the 1-hour workshop, stay longer for Q&amp;A. It&#39;s optional to bring your own bike. Dave will spend the first hour doing a demo on a PUBLIC bike &amp; then can spend some time after the Q&amp;A helping individuals with their bikes.  About PUBLIC: PUBLIC’s mission is to encourage all of us to be more conscious of, and intelligent about the way we get around in our daily lives. Our inspiration comes from European cities that are, in general, more dedicated to public spaces and sidewalks than to streets for automobiles.   Our bikes have been designed around the style and principles of the classic city bikes of Europe, updated with new technology and modern materials, and adapted to the U.S. market.  About the instructor: Dave has spent the majority of his life in the bicycle industry.  Growing up as a bicycle racer on the road, mountain and bmx Dave has a great appreciation all forms of the bicycle.  After 5 years of racing professionally in Belgium and France, Dave decided to take a step back from competition and focus on sharing his love of bicycles with a wider audience.  Dave dreams of a San Francisco with separated bike lanes and dedicated bicycle traffic signals that connect all parts of the city.

Presenter: Cole Geissinger

Advanced Theme Development assumes you have a decent grasp or understanding of HTML/CSS. If you understand the basics of programming this will come in handy, but is not required, as we will be giving some basic introductions to common programming techniques in PHP. You are not required to understand PHP or know it, but again, a basic understand will go a long ways.
In this class we&#39;ll continue sprucing up our theme we made back on day two and we&#39;ll be adding custom theme options to make our theme really stand out and give it the interaction our clients or users will need to make the theme unique to them.
This class will contain extensive use of PHP and may touch into the Database a little. Don&#39;t fret if you don&#39;t know either of these languages, as we&#39;ll be trying to lay them out in detail so you can understand what is happening. If you do understand them, it will help but is not required.

Dig in to HTML and CSS for web applications!
In this course, you&#39;ll get your hands dirty crafting a web app prototype. Each part of the prototype will introduce fundamental mechanics of HTML and CSS. Most any layout imaginable can be achieved by understanding and combining these mechanics. 
Over four classes you&#39;ll implement many patterns found in modern web applications. Here are just a handful:

a page header that remains fixed at the top of the window when you scroll
a horizontal list of navigation links
a multi-column layout
a footer that stretches to fit the width of the window
a menu that appears and disappears

By the end of the class, you will be able to lay out and style complex web applications using HTML and CSS.
To top it all off, you&#39;ll learn 5 lines of JavaScript that bring simple prototypes to life.
Are you a beginner? Intro to HTML/CSS will get you up to speed and ready for CSS For Web Apps!
 About the teacher: Sean Durham designs and develops modern web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails. By day, he&#39;s a developer at Carbon Five, an agile development shop in San Francisco.

The evolutionary perspective can be understood as a distinct &#34;worldview&#34; because it provides an expanded set of values, a new way of seeing, and a discrete sense of identity for those who make meaning using its framework.
In this dialogue, authors Steve McIntosh and Carter Phipps will discuss what it means to embrace this new framework and truly become an &#34;evolutionary.&#34; Their focus will include the evolutionary worldview&#39;s specific applications to social and political problems such as climate change.
As well as its promise to help bring about cultural evolution on every front of development, Phipps and McIntosh will also discuss emerging new forms of evolutionary spirituality and the relationship between the infinite and finite aspects of reality. One of the innovations of evolutionary spirituality is its focus on the &#34;evolutionary impulse&#34; that each of us can connect to directly. Cultivating this impulse as a spiritual practice can increase both our motivation and power in our efforts to transform both self and society.
The evening&#39;s presentation and ensuing audience discussion will draw from their new books: Evolution&#39;s Purpose (SelectBooks 2012) and Evolutionaries (Harper Perennial 2012).
 
Steve McIntosh J.D. is a leader in the integral philosophy movement and author of the books Evolution&#39;s Purpose: An Integral Interpretation of the Scientific Story of Our Origins and Integral Consciousness and the Future of Evolution. He currently works as a Founding Partner of the new social policy foundation The Institute for Cultural Evolution. In addition to this think tank, and his work in philosophy, McIntosh has had a variety of other successful careers, including founding the consumer products company Now &amp; Zen, practicing law with one of America’s largest firms, working as an executive with Celestial Seasonings Tea Company, and Olympic-class bicycle racing. He is a graduate of the University of Virginia Law School and the University of Southern California Business School, and now lives in Boulder, Colorado with his wife and two sons.

You can learn how to be free of pain! Learning what is the underlying cause of your pain will enable you to make changes that eliminate your pain. Almost everyone in highly industrialized countries has adopted a modern posture that is misaligned and so pervasive we can&#39;t even see it. Many treatments don&#39;t address the underlying cause of pain.  Learning a set of simple, specific guidelines can bring you relief from pain anytime, anywhere. The same guidelines that take away your pain also straighten your spine.  Come to a 2 hour Balance Method workshop - &#34;The 3 Myths That are Causing Your Back Pain&#34;.  IN BERKELEY: Saturday, September 22, 2012 from 6-8 pm.  RESERVATIONS ARE REQUIRED. Seating is limited.  Cost is $10.  If you register for the Balance Your Body program, you may deduct your $10 ticket fee from the tuition due.  Why do people in some countries have no back pain? 80% of the population in the United States suffers from back pain, compared to only 5% in many other countries, such as Portugal and Greece. These healthy people move slightly differently than we do. The teaching of the Balance Center is based on more than 35 years of research on these healthy populations. When you stand, bend, sit, walk, and sleep as these people do, your pain can be significantly reduced or eliminated.  SIX WAYS THIS APPROACH IS UNIQUE:  -Balance is based on studying healthy people -No special devices, special equipment or special chairs are needed -No exercises or radical positions are required -Balance dramatically improves your posture -You use this information immediately in your car, at work, even at the movies -A slight shift in position brings relief   WHAT DO PEOPLE SAY ABOUT THE RESULTS OF BALANCE?  “I have successfully used Balance Center instructions as part of a comprehensive treatment program for my patients with painful spinal conditions.” - William Firtch, M.D.  &#34;This class was a revelation for me. It increased my awareness of being out of Balance and I learned simple changes I can make to become more balanced and pain free. It was powerful learning what I can do on a daily basis to avoid pain. Dana taught us simple techniques to use everyday to correct bad posture and live pain free. It’s given me hope and has been a life changing experience that has put me back in control .&#34; - Julie Shapiro, Oakland, CA  “For 17 years I spent thousands of dollars for medical treatment and loss of work time to find a solution to relieve lower back pain due to an auto accident.  I sought treatment using acupuncture, acupressure, massage therapy, osteopathic and more.  These treatments were helpful for a short time, but it did not teach me the proper body mechanics for lifelong relief.  Surgery and continuous use of drugs was not a viable option.  The classes I took from Dana at Sonoma Body Balance were my saving grace.  I learned how to properly sit, sleep, walk, drive, bend, lift, etc.  I have not experienced any back pain since completing the classes.&#34;
-Wayland Lew  &#34;Before I took the Balance class, I experienced chronic neck, low back, hip, and gluteal tension, in spite of the fact that I received weekly chiropractic adjustments. While taking the class, my tension decreased significantly. The tools I learned in the class also enabled me to teach basic sitting skills to patients which helped eliminate a major cause of recurring back pain for many of them.&#34; -Jay Bunker, Chiropractor
Taught by Dana Davis, MA, Senior Certified Instructor by the Balance Center in Palo Alto and Certified Yoga Teacher.

We are excited to host DISCIPLE 2012 specifically for our local SF Bay area community!  Join us September 26 - 29...
DISCIPLE 2012 is a three day tutelage in the art of disciplemaking.  In the West we have assumed that discipleship is a curriculum, a course we take with a lecturer in a class room.  This is not what this is.
The first two days we will listen and discuss God’s Story as we seek to hear the truth so deeply that it affects the way we live and do life.   The last day we will have discussions centered around disciplemaking by learning–how to live the Gospel, how to speak the Gospel, how to live in community, how to live with Gospel intentionality.
This apprenticeship has limited seating.  We are strategically seeking a smaller and more intimate cohort. Due to the dialogical nature of the storyforming and disciplehood retooling we only have space for 40 people. This is not a seminar or conference, its an intensive immersion into the art and culture of making disciples.
We will provide breakfast and snacks each day for the duration of DISCIPLE 2012.  There are a limited number of SF Lighthouse family home stay locations availble on a first come, first serve basis.  For more information and to request one of these spaces visit the DISCIPLE 2012 website.

This is a 3 day iPhone and iPad Application Development Class with a time commitment from 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM each day. The only prerequisite to this class is a desire to learn, a MAC and an installation of XCode 4.3
Description:
We begin the class with an overview of XCode, SDK and Templates. We use the view based application as a beginning reference point to study the templates that come equipped with Xcode. Through this process you are able to create your 1st simple application.  Then we look at how to customize Xcode and understand tab views.
In the afternoon we start by looking at the basic structure of iPhone applications and the SDK. We look at Model-View-Controller, Delegation, Event Handling, Block Objects and Managed Memory Model.  Then we will go over Objective-C Syntax, Classes, Objects, Properties and Dot-Notation is covered in detail. Then we will go over iOS5 in detail . 
Day 2 begins with coffee in the morning and a review of day 1.
The 1st new topic covered on day 2 is the process of developing a utility application. We start by using the interface builder and utilize UIKit classes, view controllers and views. We utilize labels, images, buttons and button-like control, gesture recognizers and text fields. We use notification systems and Block objects. We also learn about the functionality of scroll and view using core animation. We learn about target-action, outlets and how to work with properties. We learn how to save data to user preferences and then call on that data using core data. Lunch is usually served during around this time.
We begin afternoon session with Web Views.  We use Web View to conduct some activities including dialing a number. Then we use Core Animation for including animation and also learn how to access your device library. Then we learn about debugger and use breakpoint to see the execution of our application. Then we understand how to provision an application so that it runs on iPhone and how to have your app beta tested by other users. Then we look at how to package your app for the App store, how to submit it to the app store with least likelihood of rejection. This concludes day 2.
Day 3 begins with an overview of the topics covered in previous two days. On day 3 we have an exercise filled day. We work on all the functionalities for an application. We cover the design process; the user interface and application design. We work with Table Views (customization). We edit user preferences and add our own settings to the preferences to Settings application. We work with content from the application bundle and downloaded content from the web. We work with web views, how to access web content and utilize own content. We work with property lists, create and restore files. We use tab views to navigate the application pages and get fully comfortable with the Tab View functionality.
Day 3 is a practice day and also a day to answer any unanswered questions from day 1 and day 2. The exercises on day 3 aim to cover all practical functionalities of Application Development . We also cover mapping and location services, create custom annotations, use reverse geocoding (work with coordinates and map display), core location, managing battery drain, running your application in the background, display location based information with the application running in the background or the foreground. We practice working with dates, add date events to users calendars and create protocol to manage modal controller. We look at how your application will work both on iPhone and iPad.
We keep the last hour of the class to cover any unanswered question. The description may sound daunting; however by the end of the 3rd day all students are comfortable with the development process. We get you on your way to iPhone and iPad application development.

Session 2 (1:30pm-5pm): Mastering the Frequent-Flier Game and Flying in LuxuryMeeting Trauma and Finding Balance: A Somatic Approach to Zen Practice

Saturday, September 29 10 am - 5 pm with Rev. Jiko Jane Lazar, SEP and Patricia Meadows, SEP  Conference Center, 308 Page Street  6 CE credits available - see below.*  Both in our meditation practice and in our daily lives, we may encounter situations or internal states that are difficult to meet with compassionate presence. This could be the result of accumulated stress or trauma, which may leave our physiology in a habitual or easily triggered state of fight, flight or freeze. We may experience this as constriction in the body, emotional reactivity, or intrusive thinking. Even those who don&#39;t identify with trauma may touch upon layers of overwhelm or distress in their systems as they practice and may benefit from the skills taught in this workshop.  In this one-day workshop, we will use mindfulness of the body to develop our capacity to be gently present with stuck survival energies. These then tend to release, restoring our physiology to a more balanced state.  Some of the skills taught in this workshop are based on Somatic Experiencing®, an approach to resolving life stress or trauma, developed by Dr. Peter Levine.  There will be optional experiential exercises as well as presentation and discussion. Skills presented can be practiced on your own.  Enrollment will be limited to 25 people. Add $15 to receive CE credit.*  *Six CEUs available for MFTs, LCSWs, psychologists and nurses. The $15 fee for CE credit can be paid at the time of registration. San Francisco Zen Center and the Spiritual Competency Resource Center team together to offer CE credit to MFTs, LCSWs, psychologists and nurses.

Jiko Jane Lazar, SEPRev. Jiko Jane Lazar, SEP*, was ordained as a Zen Priest in 2005 by Tenshin Reb Anderson and has trained residentially at Green Gulch Farm and Tassajara for eleven years. She served as shuso with Abbot Steve Stücky in the Fall of 2009. Having discovered her own unresolved trauma through zazen, she found Somatic Experiencing® (SE) to be of profound help and a strong complement to Zen practice. Now a certified Somatic Experiencing® Practitioner*, she sees her work as helping others to develop the capacity to face difficult karma with presence and compassion. Jane was a certified trainer in Nonviolent Communication between 1995 and 2000.  Patricia Meadows, SEPPatricia Meadows, SEP*, is a certified Somatic Experiencing® Practitioner* and a holistic nurse counselor. She brings 40 years experience in nursing, nursing and healthcare education, counseling, healing and trauma resolution work.

Banana peels? Learn the easiest and most effective way to compost, including how to effectively recycle your kitchen scraps and how to maximize carbon and nitrogen in your pile. Composting with the GROW BIOINTENSIVE method is the basis for growing the healthiest, most nutritious, and most pest- and disease-resistant plants. Bring a 5-gallon bucket of “green material” (grass clippings, young weeds and/or non-meat kitchen scraps). This ever-popular class includes a hands-on demonstration at the Common Ground Garden. Taught by Robin Mankey. Robin works to connect people with the earth through growing food and through her local company, Take Root. She helps get home gardens going and keeps them ﬂourishing. She is co-author of Ecology Action’s Booklet 34 – Food for the Future Now.
Everybody knows that bargain shopping in department stores these days is like having the cherry on the cake – it’s so easy to find sale items and bargains.  But let’s not overlook the smaller stores and the antique collectives?  Even the big box retailers offer quality and stylish fashion at great prices.  In this group class you will learn
•        How to think outside the box of your traditional shopping patterns to find chic, unique fashion choices.
•        To plan for your purchases instead of just hunting for the latest, greatest and cheapest.
•        What it takes to be fashion savvy and bargain happy in a city with an enormous fashion selection.
•        How not to fall victim to fads and trends that cost you more (disposable fashion)
•        To look for inexpensive (but quality) options for your working wardrobe.
  This year we are offering a series of workshops that address the needs of women concerned about budgeting their money when it comes to wardrobe. Each workshop is one hour in length and includes lots of material, print outs, checklists and info for you to take and use.  Classes are limited to ten participants and fill fast so enroll asap.
 
 *If we do not recieve the minimum of 10 participants, class will be rescheduled*
 What is Agile Open California?
Agile Open California is a coalition of agile practitioners and advocates intent on providing an opportunity for learning, networking and growth to the Agile community in California and others who are interested. 
How Does it Work?
Using the Open Space Technology framework, we hold gatherings where sessions are self-organized around topics important to the participants. We invite you to take this opportunity to share your experiences, test new ideas and learn what other practitioners are thinking and doing! This is the place to learn and contribute. At Agile Open California you can attend sessions hosted by seasoned professionals, or host a session of your own. Here&#39;s an opportunity to share your favorite topic with others. Or if you have a topic you don&#39;t know much about, and would like to hear from people who do, you can convene a session and learn about your topic from the available expertise. This course teaches lay rescuers how to recognize and treat life-threatening emergencies, including sudden cardiac arrest and choking for adult, child, and infant victims.  Students also learn how to perform CPR using a barrier device and how to effectively use an AED (Automated External Defibrillator) through hands-on training and classroom lecture.ASHI CPR/AED certification card for Adult and Child is issued after all class requirements are met. Certification card is valid for two years for the home and workplace. This class does not cover First-Aid and is not adequate for Heathcare Professionals. The suggested age for participants taking this course is 14 and older (due to test comprehension and hands-on evaluation)

All classes are taught by certified Sports Basement employees who are truly dedicated to sharing their knowledge with the community.

All classes are held at:
1177 Kern Ave, Sunnyvale, CA 94085

At Cooper, we believe you learn best by putting new skills into practice solving the kinds of challenges designers face on a daily basis. That’s why we designed UX Boot Camp, a four-day crash-course in our own design methodology that gives you a real-world problem to solve along with the toolkit you’ll need to tackle it. You’ll take your designs from idea to inception with the mentorship of our best teachers and active feedback from a real client. Better yet, this particular UX Boot Camp will happen in a creative classroom setting on the working farm of our founders, Alan and Sue Cooper. Need another reason to sign up? This is a chance to hone your craft while also providing invaluable design solutions to a nonprofit in need, Alice Water&#39;s Edible Schoolyard Project (ESY). In the end you’ll walk away with a solid, portfolio-ready concept and skills you can put to work for your own projects.
Cooper&#39;s UX Boot Camp is an intensive design training for designers, developers, and product managers who have some product design experience but want to take their skills and processes to the next level. In short, it’s where people become design leaders. The class is built around hands-on activities, conducted in pairs and small teams. Participants will learn to:
•   Set the stage for effective collaboration
•   Define product and service ecosystems
•   Conduct design research using both lightweight and in-depth techniques
•   Synthesize research data into actionable next steps
•   Model personas and build empathy for their current situation
•   Storyboard future concepts
•   Design a seamless framework for a multi-platform experience (web and mobile)
•   Learn how to go beyond features and design for engagement
•   Facilitate effective design reviews
•   Pitch and present design concepts to stakeholders
Along the way, participants will also learn critical leadership and communication skills. Plus, you’ll help a nonprofit discover new, creative ways that technology can engage students, teachers, and local leaders connected to their organization.

Testimonials
&#34;I enjoyed the &#34;experiential&#34; aspect of the training - the hands on approach, mixed with presentation/teaching, was a combination that really helped me learn and retain the information. I was able to interact closely with others and work as part of a team. In most trainings, I just take notes and forget most of what I &#34;learned&#34;.&#34; - Andrew Kallemeyn, The Lampo Group
“The workshop training was grounded in delivering real value to stakeholders. The expectation of a concrete deliverable created a positive stress that motivated learning, engagement and team building amongst attendees.” – Shawn Crowley, Atomic Object
&#34;Most conferences are set up to give you a shotgun of bite-size information as you move from session to session. UX Boot Camp was critical to me in that it was comprehensive and consistent with its teaching. I got the whole picture of UX skills alongside some in-the-trench experience.&#34; - Matthew Ensor, The Lampo Group
&#34;The combination of hands on experience working with a nonprofit, and team members from other industries with varying levels of expertise was excellent. Volunteerism is important to me personally - the dedication and how fully vested our team was in delivering the best solution for the non-profit was not only educational but a refreshing change to our day-to-day jobs. Cooper did a great job to use the tools taught in the class to build empathy (as if any additional empathy was needed) for the Red Cross  which further showed the power of using design principles in all aspects of life!&#34; - Andrea Robillard, Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Companies

Web veteran and comedian Heather Gold (NPR, SXSWi, Apple) is coming to San Francisco to speak at Word Camp SF and is offering her highly successful UnPresenting workshop which has been taken and recommended by Automattic folks, makers of WordPress, including Matt Mullenweg, it&#39;s founder.
UnPresenting teaches a unique interactive performance approach to a limited number of participants in a day-long, hands-on workshop.

You&#39;ll learn the emotional mechanics that let you create quick intimacy. Go from talking TO a large group of people to talking WITH them. You already know how to have a great conversation with one person. Learn how to read the room and tranform your presentations into conversations. You&#39;ll prepare and lead a conversation with personal guidance from Heather. NO bullet points. NO slides. Just the greatness in you and the &#34;audience.&#34; 
Participants will structure and lead a conversation and receive critique and guidance from Heather. Registration is limited to 10 people.
Who should come
•Anyone who gives presentations or runs meetings and wants to energize and engage everyone in the room. 
•Designers, UX people, toolmakers and entrepreneurs who want to learn how to create space for authentic connection between people. 
•Community, social media and marketing people who start, host and continue to energize conversations.
Registration 
Tickets are transferrable and non-refundable.

 Even the best websites only convert about 2% of their first-time visitors… So what do you do with the other 98% who leave before they convert?

In this workshop, you will learn how to engage visitors so that they will return to your website, and you will have a better opportunity to convert them into real customers.

For more infomation please visit this event&#39;s listing at SFZC.org. This immersive, forty-hour training program contains a set of three comprehensive courses that provide the knowledge and skill to become a successful Scrum developer and a valuable member of a Scrum team.
Our first course is devoted to an Introduction to Scrum for Software Developers, in which you will explore the basics of the Scrum Framework and how it supports faster and simpler software development. The second course covers Design Pattern Developer Essentials, where you will discover a core set of design patterns that every developer should know, and their underlying forces. This training program concludes with the popular Scrum Software Developer Essentials course, in which you’ll learn how to write higher-quality code more rapidly and with fewer defects using test-first development, refactoring, and a variety of Agile problem-solving techniques.
You’ll be taken on a guided tour through essential practices from Scrum and XP, such as story writing, sprint planning, pair programming and test driven development, and you’ll learn how to discover patterns in problems and to emerge designs as needed. You’ll explore the principles behind the practices so you understand how to use them to make the best design choices, and you’ll gain a powerful framework for encapsulating and abstracting virtually any problem for maximum flexibility, without over-complicating the solution.
You’ll learn the secrets of high-performance, cross-functional development teams, as well as a shared design vocabulary for dramatically improving inter-team communication that can be applied equally well to new development and to maintaining or extending existing systems. You’ll then put theory into practice and apply your new skills by building the core of an application using the expert-level techniques you’ve learned for rapidly writing quality software.
By the end of this training program you’ll be armed with several new, effective tools and techniques for Scrum development that will make your software more robust, manageable, and easier to extend.
Who Should Take This Course
This training is for all team members, and has the greatest impact when the entire team can attend. This set of courses will benefit architects; designers and developers; development and product managers; software engineers/programmers; testers and QA engineers; and technical analysts, leads, and writers. Familiarity with basic Object-Oriented (OO) concepts and terminology is recommended. Participants who successfully complete the programming exercises in the Scrum Software Developer Essentials training are eligible to become a Certified Scrum Developer, and require the ability to write simple programs in Java using Eclipse or in C Sharp using Visual Studio.

 Drawing on over 20 plus years in education, writing, theater, healing arts, youth development, social justice, event planning and strategic thinking, Jason Wyman and Margaret Bacon Schulze know how to build and sustain intentional community, unearth and cultivate hidden talents, formulate thought-provoking questions and explore possible answers/solutions/new directions. Their unique dynamic bridges generations, cultures and styles to bring out the best in people, situations and communities. They met each other through the Japanese Community Youth Center 13 years ago and have cultivated a tremendous friendship that blossomed into 14 Black Poppies. Pop Stars eat food too, but what do they eat and what are their favorite foods? For this series we will make the favorite foods of Drake who likes Mexican, Italian, Chinese and Crème Brule, Rihanna who likes West Indian and Thai food, Maroon 5 whose tastes and eating varies from Vegetarian to Japanese to Mexican and Greek and finely Niki Manaj, who is a big fan of Cranberries, Almonds and Boneless Chicken Stew.
October 20-10:00am-12:00pm -NIKI MANAJ-Boneless Chicken Stew, Dried Cranberry Salad, Almond Torte, Almond Cranberry Rice Pilaf

If you had to grow all your own food on a small plot of land with minimal outside inputs, could you do it? GROW BIOINTENSIVE is a sustainable farming and gardening method that has been taught in many countries as a way for people to feed themselves even when they might not have access to much land or fertilizers. The class will explain the basic principles of this system: deep soil preparation, composting, intensive planting, companion planting, maximizing biomass production, maximizing calorie production, open-pollinated seeds, and a whole systems approach. We will also discuss the history and philosophy of GROW BIOINTENSIVE farming, as well as how to get your own project started. Taught by Ryan Batjiaka. Ryan Batjiaka is an Assistant Garden Manager at Ecology Action in Willits, CA.

How can you feed yourself using only plants that you grow? To answer this fascinating and important question, this class will examine a range of information from nutrition requirements to potato yields. You will learn the basics of how to plan a garden or mini-farm that will contain all the food you need. Special attention will be given to growing this food on as small an area as possible with little to no outside inputs. Taught by Ryan Batjiaka Ryan Batjiakais an Assistant Garden Manager at Ecology Action in Willits, CA.Because each state has their own particular flavors, tastes and influences, we will delve into this series of cooking which will present the diversity and the creativity of what makes each state and its official food, so amazing, not to mention the pride each state has for their culinary preferences!

Have you ever wondered why after spending hundreds of dollars on the latest cameras you still can&#39;t get photos you&#39;re really proud of? We&#39;re not talking about the party snapshots you post on Facebook, but stunning landscapes that can be considered fine art and grab attention for longer than 5 seconds.
Learn to capture beautiful photos and never miss a memory again.
This 3 hour class is a crash course in digital photography. Taught in our San Francisco studio (in groups of 20-25 students), you&#39;ll learn what all those knobs and dials on your DSLR do, the settings to use in any lighting condition, and even what kind of camera to buy if you don&#39;t already have one. You&#39;ll understand concepts like exposure, aperture, depth of field and shutter speed, and probably never want to use the &#34;automatic mode&#34; again.
No prior experience or camera equipment is necessary to attend. Just a desire to improve your photography skills. Take this class for yourself or gift it to a friend who&#39;s got a photographic itch to scratch.
Frequently Asked Questions


What&#39;s the class schedule? This is a 3 hour class held most Saturdays and Sundays from 10am-1pm or 3pm-6pm, and some weeknights from 7pm-10pm. The dates are scheduled approximately 1 month in advance, and more dates are added every few weeks.


What&#39;s the format of this class? It&#39;s a group class held in an indoor classroom setting in groups of 20-25 students.


I already have some photography experience from high school, or just from playing with my camera. Will this class be useful for me? Yes, it could be a good refresher for you to consolidate all the bits and pieces of knowledge you&#39;ve picked up over the years. You&#39;ll also find plenty of inspiration (in the form of some beautiful photos) to get back into photography if you haven&#39;t done it in a while. You get to ask any burning questions to a professional photographer. And it&#39;s a great way to spend an afternoon in the company of other beginners and amateurs. However, if you already have a good handle on things like shutter speed, aperture, ISO and manual mode, this class is probably going to be too basic for you.


What kind of camera do I need to attend this class? Bring whichever camera you currently own. No need to buy anything special or fancy for this class. We explain the differences between simple point &amp; shoot cameras and DSLRs, so you&#39;ll be better informed about what kind of camera to buy, should you decide to upgrade your current one.


What else should I bring to class? Anything you need to take notes on (pen, paper, iPad, laptop etc) and a snack or drink.

Aleksey Tsalolikhin, Vertical Sysadmin, Inc., authorized CFEngine trainer
Who should attend this course:
Anyone with at least a basic knowledge of system administration interested in increasing operational efficiency and sysadmin happiness.
Why do you need to know about Automated System Administration?
 Automation of system administration is the key to scalability. It helps not only in change management but also in knowledge management (documenting the intended state of your system and the reasons why it is configured that way). Automating your system administration is key to career progression from system administration to more interesting system engineering work.
Why CFEngine 3?
CFEngine is the granddaddy of policy-based configuration management systems, and CFEngine version 3 increases the power and flexibility of managing network-attached computers. CFEngine can operate in the widest variety of environments, from embedded sensors to supercomputers, from underwater to outer space. It can run on the widest range of operating systems and has the smallest resource footprint. CFEngine is a very powerful tool.
What you will take back to work:
A thorough grounding in automating system administration using CFEngine 3 and the ability to implement configuration policies on your systems.  You will be able to automatedly handle and control files, processes, packages, and commands, all resulting in Correct and Known Configuration on your servers.  You will know how to set up CFEngine client-server, so that you can use it at scale.
What this course covers:

The history, design principles, and philosophy of CFEngine:

CFEngine 1: A configuration management language to handle different Unix systems
CFEngine 2: Computer Immunology and Convergence to Desired State
CFEngine 3: The Promise Model
The importance of abstraction for knowledge management


The Basic Grammar of CFEngine 3:

Promises of desired system state
Promise atributes
Collections of promises
Collections of promise attributes


The CFEngine 3 Data Types and How to Use Them:

Scalar variables: Strings, integers, and real numbers
Lists of Scalars
Arrays


How to use Patterns in Promises to Describe Configuration Efficiently:

Classifying servers to control when and where configuration promises apply using CFEngine &#34;classes&#34;
Leveraging the power of regular expressions
Using lists to drive action: add or remove users, install or delete packages, and so on.
Re-using code by abstracting promise attributes into parameterizable promise bodies
Re-using code by abstracting promise bundles into parameterizable methods


Advanced CFEngine Topics

Selecting files using simple and compound filters
Selecting processes using simple and compound filters
Configuring a CFEngine client-server system
Generating reports; how CFEngine can help you audit and report compliance.


Many practical examples and exercises to help seed your policy set.
Demonstration of the Enterprise edition of CFEngine.

The course balances theory and practical.  See the complete course plan.
Requirements: Attendees are expected to be familiar with command-line Linux/UNIX utilities and basic system administration tasks (installation software, setting up networking, etc). Each attendee will be asked to bring a laptop with two VMs installed that can talk to each other (one VM should be able to SSH into the other) for the client-server configuration exercise.
About the Instructor
Aleksey Tsalolikhin has been administering UNIX systems for over 14 years. At EarthLink, which grew to over 5,000,000 users, Aleksey, frustrated by wrangling hundreds of servers by hand, developed an abiding interest in automating configuration management.  Aleksey has been using CFEngine for 5 years.  Aleksey is a member of LOPSA, USENIX, ACM and IEEE Computer Society.  He&#39;s a full-time system administrator.  Aleksey writes and teaches about distributed system configuration management tools in general and CFEngine in particular.  Aleksey was trained on CFEngine by Mark Burgess, the author of CFEngine.
Note: This course is conditional on at least 6 students registering.  
Student Successes 
 &#34;The balance between theoretical and practical knowledge is just perfect. No bullshit.&#34; 
--B.B.
Thank you for such a great class.  Been to lots of technical training and you are the best instructor I&#39;ve had.  Beyond standard lecture/lab your examples and willingness to help with non-class related questions pertaining to CFEngine is unmatched.
-- T.N.I was able to &#34;unlearn&#34; some of my bad habits that came with my legacy cfengine2 set up. A lot of the things that previously made cfengine3 daunting to me are now clear and approachable.
-- B.B.
The examples presented were easy to follow and provided me the chance to ask questions. You were very thorough about your explanation of various aspects of the CFEngine software and were always willing to go over things more as people had questions that they needed to ask.
--C.L.
Hands on was good, I also really liked being able to ask questions about things have no documentation, or recommended ways of doing complex configuration.
--D.F.
Training has helped me improve my troubleshooting skills of CFEngine3. I have understood some of the design goals and now clearly understand the syntax of CFEngine promises. ... Very personal approach to teaching. We are bored to death with power point slides. Most of the class was hands on.
--P.R.
It was more in-depth and intensive than most of the vendor training things I&#39;ve gone to, not a lot of starting late, leaving early, etc. Good attention to detail and making sure all points were understood.
--M.S.Basic First Aid: This workshop is certified through the American Heart Association and facilitated by REVIVE. This workshop is designed for staff who must certify or re-certify as a requirement for YMCA employment.
A refresher course is required every 2 years.

 Balancing Compassion and Self-Care: A Retreat for People in the Helping Professions
 
Saturday, October 27 9 am - 4 pm with Jisan Tova Green and Keiryu Liên Shutt  Conference Center, 308 Page StreetCEUs available - see note* below.  As people working in the health professions, our efforts go towards helping others in need every day. It can be hard to say no or to stop in the midst of our busy days to check in and see how we feel or what we may need.  Do you find it difficult to balance caring for others and caring for yourself? If so, this workshop will help you explore ways to tune into yourself in the midst of a demanding work setting and to get support from others – co-workers, employers, friends and others outside of work.  This retreat will include Zen contemplative practices (sitting and walking meditation), Dharma teachings, and exercises to identify our needs, clarify our boundaries, and develop methods of self-care.  The morning will be dedicated to settling ourselves through walking and sitting meditation. In the afternoon we will explore how to balance caring for others and self care through exercises and small group discussions on issues such as practicing wise effort, internal vs. external focus, and what it really means to be compassionate to ourselves and others. Lunch and tea are included. *Add $15 for CEU certificate fee, from the ticket-types above.*NOTE about CEUs: 6 CEUs available for MFTs, LCSWs, psychologists and nurses.

 CAMP RED 2012 (ages 9-15 yrs)
In 2011 we had an amazing experience at Camp RED during our first year. From the first greetings, to the Friday night film festivals it was a rewarding experience for the campers and RED. 
For 2012, weeks 1 and 2 of Camp RED are a Day camp, from 9am to 5pm, 5 days a week.  They will be held at RED Studios Hollywood, right in the heart of the movie making business.  We will host the Camp in some of the classic Hollywood Sound Stages where many important films and TV shows were shot over the last 100 years! Campers are welcome to attend one or both of the first two weeks.
We will have many more details about the 2012 program in the months to come but the dates are set! Three total  weeks are set for Camp RED beginning on July 30th, with the third week again being our sleep away camp in Malibu. 
Photos and videos from the 2011 edition can be found at gallery.me.com/reducation and www.vimeo.com/campred.
Campers will shoot with the high end movie cameras that RED creates, edit their work with professional editing tools and see their finished work on the big screen, just like a big Hollywood production!  In fact, they will be shooting and showing the movies they create in 4k, with state of the art projection and the highest resolution movie cameras working today, the RED ONE and RED EPIC cameras.  Campers will literally be on the cutting edge of the movie business, using the most advanced tools out there to make and screen their work.  This is the technology that many people in the movie and TV business dream of working with on their projects, and they will be using it every day!where the nurses areA must-attend opportunity for experienced RNs

AIA|LA Interior Architecture Committee presents
Speaker Series: Product Design For Architectural Interiors
 AIA members can earn 1.5 learning units for attending this program

Date: Tuesday August 7, 2012
Time: 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM
Location: Howard Building Corporation707 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90017
Pricing: Free AIA Members / $15.00 Non Members 

Join the AIA|LA Interior Architecture Committee for a night of lively discussion and instruction from noted product designers in this stimulating CEU presentation that will address the process of product design; overarching themes inherent to all product design; how seasoned product designers approach and partner with a manufacturer to implement a design; and how to avoid the common pitfalls of poor product design. The cast will include Stanley Felderman of Felderman Keating, Pam Light of HOK, and Lee Pasteris of Gensler (see presenter bios below). 

STANLEY FELDERMANPartner &amp; Founder, Felderman Keatinge + Associates

Stanley Felderman creates buildings, interiors and products that introduce new design ideas in a corporate style, often with a playful twist, and with extraordinary attention to detail and end-user needs. He is a quick-study strategist, who walks through the problem-solving process with his clients with the assistance of pen and paper. Whether corporate facilities for the Hollywood studios, MTV Networks or technology companies like Guidance Solutions; restaurants and clubs in Beverly Hills and Tokyo, or products for worldwide distribution, the ideas are fresh and original, whimsical and provocative--and appropriate for each client. Today, Felderman Keatinge + Associates are applying these ideas on a global basis. Recent LA-based projects include the corporate law offices of Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton, LLP, iCrete, a young technology company; Holthouse Carlin &amp; Van Trigt, an accounting firm; Elizabeth&#39;s Murdoch&#39;s Shine Group; the entertainment law firm Barnes Morris; and FKA&#39;s own offices in Century City, CA, among others. Additionally, they have just launched a new cross over chair collection with Haworth, which debuted at Neocon this past June. The well-choreographed balance of innovative design and precise planning and detailing which Mr. Felderman established in his first project in l97l-- the corporate headquarters of Faberge in New York City-- set the stage for the direction he and his partner, Nancy Keatinge, continue today. As Phillip Johnson once said to Stanley, &#34;most people end their career with a project like Faberge, not start it.&#34; A focus on the details has been a distinguishing thread throughout the body of his work. Another is his multi-disciplinary approach: he is as adept with the architecture and design of buildings as he is with products and exhibits. New technology and computer capability allow FKA to conceptualize and develop new environmental forms, then to integrate real issues and incorporate program criteria into their design solutions. They counsel clients who embrace the reality that globality and technology define the work- and marketplaces today, and that business is in a continuous state of evolution and change. Using strategic intelligence and innovative design, they guide and support their client partners through the revealing process of evaluation, definition, structuring and positioning. As a pioneer of the &#34;total design concept,&#34; he has integrated planning, architecture, interior design and product design. Utilizing this concept, Mr. Felderman&#39;s work ranges from large scale projects as the master planning and design of the (22) city block mixed use community Centrage in Sacramento, California to product/industrial design including corporate jets, china and glassware for Sasaki, furniture for ARC International, The Gunlocke Corporation, Haworth, Knoll International, Vogel Peterson, Herman Miller, Interface, Steelcase and the Italian manufacturer, Venini. Stanley&#39;s work has been widely recognized with a number of awards, including the &#34;Best Executive Office Design&#34; from Interiors for Columbia Pictures, &#34;Restaurant of the Year&#34; from Restaurant and Hotel Design magazine for the Le Triangle restaurant, an Honor Award from the Los Angeles chapter of the American Institute of Architects for the CalMat corporation headquarters, and the RAS Industrial Design Award for Mr. Felderman&#39;s design of a G-2 jet for the L.J. Hooker Corporation. Mr. Felderman has judged design competitions worldwide, and has won numerous design awards. His work is featured in many books, as well as featured in articles in the New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, Newsweek - both in the U.S. and Japan, The Wall Street Journal, Progressive Architecture, Interior Design, Interiors, Architectural Record, and Architecture Magazine, and many others. His designs have been exhibited in the Newport Harbor Art Museum, The Museum of Modern Art in New York, as well as the Whitney Museum. He teaches and lectures regularly. Among the organizations he has addressed are Salone Internazionale Della Sedia in Udine, Italy; NeoCon in Chicago, WestWeek in Los Angeles, several AIA chapters, Newport Harbor Art Museum, the University of California at Irvine, and Pratt Institute in Brooklyn.

&#34;The absolute best class you can take on how to make your own low/no budget film. Seriously.&#34; - Signe Olynyk, Founder, Great American Pitchfest; Writer/Producer, &#34;Below Zero&#34;
&#34;The No Budget Film School is designed for the moviemaker who possesses nothing but a dream and a drive. If you take the course and can&#39;t make some kind of film at the end of it, you&#39;ll have no one to blame but yourself. &#34; - Peter MacNicol (Emmy Award Winning Actor: Allie McBeal, Numb3rs, Sophie&#39;s Choice)
&#34;Your workshop was fantastic--well worth the money in my no budget filmmaking world. I&#39;m a graduate of UCLA film school and two of my screenplays were considered by the Sundance Institute Screenwriters Lab. You and your guest speakers inspired my husband and I to move forward, honor our uniqueness, and trust our intuition instead of playing the approval game. You&#39;ve liberated us! Thanks a million for sharing your experiences.&#34; - Chien-ei Yu
&#34;I cannot say enough about the two-day class we just completed today...the course was fantastic!! I feel like I have learned in two days, what would&#39;ve taken me several years of experience and experimentation to learn. Thanks for sharing your wealth of experience and knowledge with us.&#34; - Monica Vazquez
&#34;The best filmmaking training money I ever spent.&#34; - Amir Masud, Writer/Director, Affliction

No Budget Film School presents it&#39;s famed &#34;The Art &amp; Science Of No-Budget Filmmaking&#34; two-day seminar.  No-budget first features launched the careers of filmmakers like Christopher Nolan (Inception, The Dark Knight), Joe Carnahan (The A-Team, Narc), Darren Aronofsky (Black Swan, The Wrestler), Marc Forster (Quantum of Solace, Finding Neverland), David Gordon Green (Your Highness, Pineapple Express), Justin Lin (Fast Five, Fast &amp; Furious), and Craig Brewer (Footloose, Hustle &amp; Flow).  These first films all went through the offices of Next Wave Films, the former low-budget financing arm of IFC.  Now producer Mark Stolaroff--a principal of Next Wave--is sharing what he&#39;s learned from years in the trenches of no-budget independent filmmaking in this in-depth, one-of-a-kind class. 
Micro-budget (under $200,000) filmmaking is unique.  The methods, models, and priorities are radically different from those of studio or even &#34;low&#34; budget $1 million films. In this class, students will learn the rules of micro-budget production critical to making this type of film successfully, whether the budget is $200,000 or $200. Attendees will walk away with powerful ideas that they can use immediately, saving them time and money, and preventing fatal mistakes that could doom otherwise worthy projects.  Guest speakers provide an up-to-the-minute perspective on what works and what doesn&#39;t in the current no-budget landscape.  These cutting-edge techniques can NOT be found in a book, at film school, or in other film classes.  For filmmakers who are preparing to make their micro-budget features, this class is indispensable.  The approaches taught will enable filmmakers to maximize very limited resources and minimize critical errors that can doom otherwise worth projects.

LEARN cutting edge techniques and how to choose the latest digital cameras and software
HEAR no-budget professionals offer first-hand knowledge of production, post production, marketing, and distribution
EXAMINE a budget line-by-line and discover where and how to spend money (and, more importantly, not spend money)--whether your budget is $200,000 or $200
SEE clips from micro-budget films illustrating the tricks-of-the-trade used by resourceful filmmakers
MEET other like-minded filmmakers and find teammates who will help you make your no-budget project a reality

If you&#39;re through talking about being a filmmaker and ready to become one, this will be the most practical filmmaking class you will ever take.

The classes will be held at Raleigh Studios&#39; Chaplin Theater, from 9:30am to 6pm, on August 4th &amp; 5th (though plan on staying until about 7pm on the 5th).  Single day tickets are also available for each day. Tuition includes class materials, plus several special offers and giveaways! 
 
CINEMA LANGUAGE DISCOUNT!
&#34;The Art &amp; Science of No-Budget Filmmaking&#34; is being held alongside Tom Provost&#39;s essential &#34;Cinema Language: The Art of Storytelling&#34; class, which takes place the following weekend, August 11th &amp; 12th.  You can take each class separately, or together and save. A special &#34;Gift Basket&#34; of goodies will be provided to students who take all four days.  For more information on &#34;The Art &amp; Science of No-Budget Filmmaking,&#34; see below.  For more information on &#34;Cinema Language,&#34; visit the Cinema Language Eventbrite page.  The two-weekend, four-day package can be purchased on this page or on the Cinema Language page.

&#34;The Art &amp; Science of No-Budget Filmmaking&#34;
DAY ONE - SATURDAY, AUGUST 4, 2012
Course 101: &#34;The Art of No-Budget Filmmaking&#34;
&#34;Tremendous stuff, all weekend long, and so professionally put together. The &#39;write to your definition of no-budget/write to your resources&#39; philosophy at the center of your teaching really came through and rang true -- absolutely vital, and really sums it up.&#34; - Chris Soth, Screenwriting Instructor

This course gives filmmakers the tools and the confidence to make a feature right now, with the resources available to them, however limited those resources might be.  The class offers a unique overview of Production, Post Production and Distribution from a no-budget perspective, encouraging filmmakers to throw out old templates of moviemaking.  The approach guides filmmakers to examine their own specific circumstances--their limitations and their resources--and reinvent the moviemaking process to suit their unique situation.  Learn:

How to design a great script that will cost little or no money to produce
How to devise a production that conforms to your particular circumstances
How to prioritize limited resources
How to tackle post production, festival strategy and distribution on a shoestring
Much, much more


HIGHLIGHTS FROM DAY ONE: 
•  Peter Broderick, considered the leading authority on alternative distribution strategy, will give an empowering presentation on maximizing distribution with new, innovative techniques; and will also discuss Crowdfunding, with platforms like Kickstarter and IndieGoGo. Broderick has been one of low-budget filmmaking&#39;s leading experts since the early 90&#39;s. He wrote a series of articles for Filmmaker Magazine back then that helped drive the micro-budget filmmaking movement.  In 1997 he founded Next Wave Films, which helped launch the careers of filmmakers like Christopher Nolan, Joe Carnahan, Amir Bar-Lev and many others.  Now, as the President of Paradigm Consulting, he is a sought-after consultant, speaker, and producers rep.
• Writer/Director Michael Mohan will discuss his no-budget feature One Too Many Mornings, which premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. The success of this film allowed him to make the higher budget feature Save The Date, which premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival and was subsequently picked up for distribution by IFC Films.  Mike has the unusual distinction of attending three Sundances in a row, (he had a short in the 2011 fest). Mike will also talk about the differences between making a no-budget film with available resources and a more conventionally produced low-budget film. 
•  Jacob Rosenbeg, the Chief Technology Officer of Bandito Brothers, a media company best known for producing the recent studio film Act Of Valor, will discuss post production on a micro-budget.  An author, filmmaker, and digital technology expert, Jacob was a senior consultant for Adobe Systems before his groundbreaking work as an online editor and digital intermediate supervisor on the award-winning documentary, Dust To Glory, which mixed nine different video formats seamlessly.  He was also a technical advisor on Bryan Singer&#39;s Superman Returns, Martin Scorsese&#39;s Shine The Light, and James Cameron&#39;s Avatar.

DAY TWO - SUNDAY, AUGUST 5, 2011
Course 201:  &#34;The Science of No-Budget Filmmaking&#34;
&#34;I can&#39;t tell you enough how helpful I found your No Budget Budgeting lecture. So many things you spoke about that day have come up for me. I&#39;m very glad I took your class.&#34; - Pamela Pedder 
A detailed line-by-line analysis of the production budget from a no-budget perspective.  Topics include: Cast &amp; Casting, Crew, Equipment, Insurance, Locations, Permits, Props/Set Dressing, Vehicles, Makeup/Wardrobe, Camera/Format, Sound, Legal, and Miscellaneous Budget Items.  The class will dissect the production of the $50,000 feature True Love (a Sundance Screenwriters Lab Project), demonstrating the low-budget tricks used--and the mistakes made--showing clips from the film and valuable behind-the-scenes footage, in this comprehensive examination of a no-budget film.  Learn:

How to find great cast &amp; crew with little or nothing to pay
How to shoot in LA without filming permits
How to get free locations, free props, and free equipment
What formats, cameras, and editing systems to use
Much, Much more


HIGHLIGHTS FROM DAY TWO: 
•  Writer/director Drake Doremus will reveal the no-budget tricks behind his two very successful no-budget features, Douchebag, which premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, and Like Crazy, which was the hit of the 2011 Sundance and ultimately won the Grand Jury Prize there.  Both films were made with inexpensive cameras, tiny crews and improvised scripts, and both were picked up for distribution, with Like Crazy going out through Paramount and grossing several million dollars. Drake is currently in post on his newest film, which stars Guy Pierce.
• Louise Runge and Samantha Housman, producing partners at OneZero Films, will talk about producing their no-budget hit film 28 Hotel Rooms, which premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival and was picked up for theatrical distribution by Oscilloscope Pictures. The film stars Chris Messina and Marin Ireland, and was written and directed by Matt Ross, who is perhaps best known for playing the role of Alby Grant on HBO&#39;s Big Love.
•  FSI:  Film Scene Investigation - analyze scenes from an award-winning no-budget movie, from script to screen.  Hear the scenes read, get the opportunity to identify and solve production problems, learn how those problems were solved in the movie, see behind-the-scenes footage of the scenes&#39; set-up, then see the filmed scenes in their finished form.
•  Filmmaker Tom Provost will give a preview of his Cinema Language class, taking place the following weekend, and will be on-hand throughout the two days as a resource.  Writer/director/producer Provost&#39;s independently financed and produced new feature The Presence, starring Oscar-winner Mira Sorvino, Golden Globe nominee Justin Kirk, and Shane West, has won numerous awards at festivals throughout the past year and is being released by Lionsgate in October.

We are sharing our proven techniques and strategies for getting bank controlled properties at a reasonable price. The presentation will provide a conceptual overview backed up by a number of specific property purchases.Program Summary:
The FDA regulations for medical devices have been in place for over 35 years, but are changing more rapidly now than ever before.  These days FDA expects quality to be pervasive throughout an organization and not relegated to simple manufacturing process controls.   The Agency is also revising the 510(k) regulatory submission process, a fundamental pathway for new product clearances.  It is imperative that device developers, manufacturers and distributors understand these changing regulations and implement the necessary controls and processes.  This presentation will provide a high level overview of the FDA regulatory process, from testing through submission and clearance/approval, as well as the quality system requirements, both under the regulations and from a best business practices perspective.
 
Program Themes:

FDA Medical Device Classification and Submission Process
FDA Quality System Requirements – Pre and Post Marketing
Regulatory Harmonization in a Global Economy

Investment Banking Workshop
Duration: 2 days
Cost: Free (RSVP cost is refunded upon attendance)
Location: UCLA - Ackerman Grand Ballroom
Audience: this event is open to all undergraduate and graduate students from all universities, colleges, and high schools from Los Angeles and neighboring regions.
Details: this 2-day event is designed to help students break into the field of investment banking. The workshop will teach students how to build a resume for investment banking and will train them for the technical and behavioral portions of investment banking interviews. During the workshop we will continuously assess the participants and will invite a select few to the Leaders Candidate Program, allowing them to become a part of the global network of graduates from the Leaders initiative. The program helps candidates with mentoring, networking, and career opportunities. Therefore, it is recommended that students who are passionate about a career in finance participate in this event and try their best to involve themselves in class discussions. Please note, students who do not attend the complete 2-day workshop will not be considered for the Leaders Candidate Program.
Schedule: the timeline of the event along with the details of each workshop are as follows:

Day 1.A: Oct 6 | 9:00 am - 11:00 am | Resume Workshop | Details: this workshop teaches the candidates how to create a resume that not only looks professional, but will help you in making the most of a single sheet of paper. We will teach the class the Leaders resume format and work through various content examples that can be included in the resume. The format taught here can be used for any profession or any other situation where a resume is required.
Day 1.B: Oct 6 | 11:00 am - 2:00 pm | Behavioral Workshop | Details: this workshop teaches students how to properly answer questions such as why investment banking. The workshop covers important topics such as explaining your “story” and how to properly answer questions related to both educational and professional experience.

From there, the workshop covers recruiting events, informational sessions, and seminars,  examining techniques to use these opportunities to stand out from the rest of the student body. Remember, it&#39;s not what you know, but who you know.
Day 2.A: Oct 7 | 9:00 am - 12:00 pm | Technical Workshop - Accounting | Details: this workshop teaches students the basic and advanced concepts required for acing the technical portion of investment banking interviews.

The mastery of this section is mandatory for passing first-round and final-round interviews.
Day 2.B: Oct 7 | 12:00 pm - 3:00 pm | Technical Workshop - Valuation | Details: this advanced workshop teaches students the various types of valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows, comparable companies analysis and precedent transaction analysis.

Why do I Charge So Little?
Because I don&#39;t need a lot, I&#39;m NOT a seminar guru. I don&#39;t do seminars to make money. I buy largeCommercial Real Estate properties to make money &amp; have been doing so for the past 12 years. I just need enough to cover my expenses, maybe a little more, &amp; that&#39;s it.
Why Should I Learn from The Business Codex?
Because most of the Business Credit Trainers that are out there originally learned from Jorge Bueno or from someone that Jorge trained. The same trainers charging you $12,000 to $100,000 to teach you this Corporate Credit Material learned it here first. Do you want to listen to 4th generation rehashed material or do you desire the &quot;Real Work&quot; that has worked for people like you &amp; families like yours? 
Does The Business Codex work &amp; can you prove it?
Yes, I&#39;ve used it to fund my Real Estate deals for 12 years! Go to http://CodexProof.com to view testimonial videos or consider coming to my introductory 2-Day Workshop &amp; you be the judge. http://CodexEvent.com 
How come I haven&#39;t heard of Jorge Bueno?
I&#39;m too busy making money &amp; participating in high commerce. I&#39;m also NOT a Seminar Pitchman. Most of those people only make money selling you Bootcamps &amp; Home Study Courses. Let me prove it to you. All of my wealthy neighbors &amp; friends keep their business secrets to themselves. One of my neighbors started a very an extremely popular &quot;Energy Drink&quot; with sales of $200 + Million every year. You will NEVER see him organizing a workshop on &quot;How to Get Rich with your Own Energy Drink!&quot;
Another neighbor is a builder. He has developed many of the Casinos on the Las Vegas Strip &amp; also does Heavy Civil Work for the Government, like building Military Bases, Freeways, Subways, etc. You will NEVER see him running a workshop on &quot;How to make Billions in the Construction Business&quot;
I can go on &amp; on with comparisons but I don&#39;t have to because you get it. Next time you&#39;re in your downtown metropolis look up to the huge $250 Million Skyscrapers &amp; ask yourself:I wonder if &quot;Real Estate Seminar Guru&quot; owns this building?&quot; The answer is NO, Guaranteed. They&#39;re too busy running live events across the country trying to sell you their Platinum Coaching or whatever they call thier expensive programs. Don&#39;t take my word for it. Ask around, &amp; you will realize that I&#39;m correct.

How does the Mastery Class Agenda Flow?
 
 
1. We will meet for 5 weeks on private webinars &amp; I will deliver the entire Business Codex Structure for    getting the money you need to FUND your Mission in life...your Passion.....&amp; your Business! This is some of the same information that I give to my private consultation clients that pay $30,000 for 8 hours of my time.
2. We will go through the entire 37 Step Action Plan! I will also start a new corporation with the class and I will tell you what to do in the exact sequence for optimal results. We will do this together as a Core Team starting from scratch. You will have tasks to complete &amp; I will deploy more documents to you every week.
3. The Mastery Team will then be given access to meet in secret for a Private 2 Day Advanced Workshop on the weekend of December 11 &amp; 12 2010. The Advanced Mastery Workshop has a value of $1997 by itself! If you&#39;re a Mastery Student in good standing, you will NOT have to pay for it. Additional advanced strategies &amp; ninja secrets will be revealed there along with mental processes. This will be an opportunity for me to help you &quot;Tune Up&quot; your corporation &amp; make sure you&#39;re on the right track. Throughout history all advanced learning was done in person. This is where I connect the dots on the entire Business Codex System. We will discuss all of the important items that has been LEFT OUT of the webinars and documents ON PURPOSE. We need to do it this way in case the Business Codex Material accidentally gets into the wrong hands. 4. Welcome to the Mastery Class you will not experience any high pressure tactics or sales techniques here. If I detect that your intentions are not correct or if I detect that you may not be ready to receive the secrets...I will promptly issue you a refund. I&#39;m only looking for a few people to mentor, only 12 individuals at a time.5. HUGE BONUS! The top two Mastery Participants in 2010 that raise the highest amount in Business Credit &amp; Funding will be our VIP guests at the next Grammy Awards on Sunday February 13, 2011. You will meet us in Los Angeles, Get yourself a Hotel room. We&#39;ll then pick you up from your hotel in a Limo &amp; you&#39;ll ride with us to the Red Carpet. Tickets are not available to the general public and it would cost you Thousands of Dollars if you could find tickets...but not with us...you will be our guests of honor.

  A Day with Nils Bergman, MD: The Science &amp; Evidence of Skin-to-Skin and Breastfeeding
Tuesday, September 11, 2012
9:00am to 4:00pm
Download Brochure 

Faculty:
Nils Bergman, MB ChB, DCH, MPH, MD
Public Health Physician
South Africa
Program Description
Dr Bergman’s passion starts with “skin-to-skin contact”, his preferred term for what many people call Kangaroo Care. Dr Bergman regards maternal-infant skin-to-skin contact as a first and critical intervention in perinatology, with broad public health impacts and implications. His expertise extends to developmental neuroscience, breastfeeding, neonatology and obstetrics.
He takes an integrated view of these areas, regarding skin-to-skin contact as the neurological pre-requisite to successful breastfeeding, with neonatal and obstetric care re-orienting its purpose to maintaining the integrity of the mother-infant dyad. This holistic view he terms “Kangaroo Mother Care”.  He worked previously as a hospital manager and is currently a Public Health Physician, and sees these issues in the broader context of hospitals, health systems and society as whole.
We are very fortunate to have Dr. Bergman with us in Los Angeles for this full day seminar.  The model of Kangaroo Mother Care, skin-to-skin contact, is utilized in many hospitals and is the foundation for the Birth &amp; Beyond curriculum.

Supreme Court’s Ruling on HealthCare Law Means Employers Must Review and Prepare For Upcoming Mandates
While the landmark ruling will have impact for years to come on its effect on Congressional power to regulate commerce, for employers,the impact of the case will be more immediate.

On April 12, 2012, the California Supreme Court issued its long-awaited decision in the Brinker case, ruling on several key questions regarding an employer&#39;s obligation to provide meal and rest breaks to its non-exempt employees while raising new areas of concern to employers.

 What is #pubcamp, anyway?
PublicMediaCamp, or PubCamp for short, is a nationwide series of gathering focused on forging greater collaboration between public media organizations and their communities. Inspired by unconferences such as Foocamp and Barcamp, PubCamps are informal opportunities for techies and community media makers to get together with NPR and PBS staff and develop projects together. PubCamp West focuses specifically on public media and community in the West.
This &#34;camp&#34; is a user generated conference where all participants will have the opportunity to plan and run the event. Participants will be invited to formulate conference tracks and sessions as part of pre-conference engagement process. Significant portions of event will also be left open and reserved for attendees to create their own sessions on the weekend of the event itself.

CAMP RED 2012 (ages 9-15 yrs)
We had an amazing experience at Camp RED during our first year. From the first greetings, to the Friday night film festivals it was a rewarding experience for the campers and RED. 
Weeks 1 and 2 of Camp RED are a Day camp, from 9am to 5pm, 5 days a week.  They will be held at RED Studios Hollywood, right in the heart of the movie making business.  We will host the Camp in some of the classic Hollywood Sound Stages where many important films and TV shows were shot over the last 100 years! Campers are welcome to attend one or both of the first two weeks.
We will have many more details about the 2012 program in the months to come but the dates are set! Three weeks beginning on July 30th with the third week again being our sleep away camp in Malibu. 
Photos and videos from the 2011 edition can be found at gallery.me.com/reducation and www.vimeo.com/campred.
Campers will shoot with the high end movie cameras that RED creates, edit their work with professional editing tools and see their finished work on the big screen, just like a big Hollywood production!  In fact, they will be shooting and showing the movies they create in 4k, with state of the art projection and the highest resolution movie cameras working today, the RED ONE and RED EPIC cameras.  Campers will literally be on the cutting edge of the movie business, using the most advanced tools out there to make and screen their work.  This is the technology that many people in the movie and TV business dream of working with on their projects, and they will be using it every day!AIA|LA Healthcare Committee Presents: The One BIGIdeaWorkshop

When: On August 15, 2012 from 4:30 pm  - 6:30 pm
Where: 800 Corporate Pointe Walk, Culver City, CA 90230, USA 

For this month&#39;s presentation of the AIA|LA Committee on Architecture in Healthcare we decided to do things a bit differently.
THE SCENARIO: You attend a presentation, meeting, symposium or luncheon. You see old friends and you meet a few new people. There&#39;s a speaker or an expert on a topic and you sit through the event and for the most part the information was good. You even learned a few new things. Maybe it was a lunch, so at least you got to eat and the most exciting part of the event was when you discover that the chicken wasn&#39;t as dry as you expected; like the last 4 chicken meals you&#39;ve recently eaten in the past week. The event is over and you were left no more excited or energized about the future of our industry than when you first arrived...
THE WORKSHOP: A couple of your peers felt the same way and we decided we needed something new and something different. For the month of August the healthcare committee won&#39;t be hosting another &#34;presentation&#34;. Instead, this month we will be conducting a workshop and need your participation! We wanted to get our members, partners and guests excited about coming to this event:
The ONE BIG IDEA WORKSHOP is about creativity, thinking innovatively and thinking about how other factors globally affect the healthcare industry.

How do we harness this information?
How will it effect us in 2, 5, or 10 years?
What is shaping how we will do business in the future?

The Challenge: Harness the creativity of our local thought leaders to envision, capture &amp; redefine the future of our industry; to imagine and create a new future.
The Exercise: To identify those elements that disrupts the status quo such as new methodologies and processes in order to shape the dialog and help be the leaders in change.
Why: If we aren&#39;t innovators we will become extinct.
The Desired Results: To take away from this workshop a new perspective; a different way of looking at the world and to lose our tunnel vision and look at the possibilities.

THE PROCESS: Sandy will start with an opening remark. Then everyone will break out into groups. Each group will have a mediator to help guide them in the direction that will result in GREAT IDEAS!
All GREAT IDEAS will be collected and discussed. Under his guidance Sandy will challenge us to take these ideas and use them to redefine the future of our industry.
This is a workshop that will be an exercise for your brain. It will challenge your perspective and you will walk way asking &#34;Why? How come? What If...and What&#39;s Next?&#34;

★ Former Deputy Assistant to President Nixon, Bruce Herschensohn will return to the Nixon Library for his new book about America’s dangerous shift in foreign policy under the Obama administration.
Now a Senior Fellow at Pepperdine University, he contends that the current and 44th President has radically moved away from his predecessors who – despite their differences – held the common view that America should stand up for its allies, as well as the  peace and freedom seeking nations of the world.
In an uncertain world,  one thing is certain according to Herschensohn, whoever takes the oath-of-office on January 20, 2013 will be a war-time president.NOTE: The workshop scheduled for April 3, 2012 has been changed to April 5, 2012

Academy
 
The level of excitement that has taken over members of FFS is both incredible and justified. ANICO brings many benefits to the table that can benefit both clients and associates alike. The number 1 request we are receiving in FFS today is for more training on the entire &#34;ANICO package&#34;. 
 
Well I am excited to announce that ANICO National Sales Manager Scott Taylor has chosen to come out and visit the Team Crusaders office in Cerritos to provide us with both basic and advanced training on all things ANICO in the form of an &#34;ANICO Academy&#34; on Saturday August 11th, 2012. Here are just a few of the things that Scott will cover: 

The ins-and-outs of the ANICO Express Underwriting Program (no blood or medical)!
The ins-and-outs of the ANICO Term Insurance that offers all 3 Living Benefits!
How to use the ANICO E-App!
How to run ANICO illustrations!
And a whole lot more!

Please keep in mind that this is a true &#34;ANICO Academy&#34; that will go from 9:00 AM sharp until 2:00 PM. Of course you can stay for as little, or as much as your schedule allows.
 
 The cost of this academy is only $10, which includes a lunch that will be catered by Bernal&#39;s Tacos &amp; Catering. The $10 does not even cover the cost of the catering, but is intended to serve as a filter to ensure that the limited number of seats go to the most serious members of our team.
 
Remember, only 30 seats will be made available for this event. Once they&#39;re gone....they&#39;re gone....
 
 
 
See you there!

Please keep in mind that all sales are FINAL and no refunds will be provided under any circumstances since we pay caterer based on the number of people that buy a ticket, not that actually attend.

We understand that applicants constitute a diverse group and therefore have diverse needs. Our conference planning committee wants to provide specific and accurate information about the admissions process by having members of various admissions committees participate in an interactive panel of experts.The day will be filled with dozens of workshops, speakers, admissions representatives, and panels of experts to bring you accurate and valuable information about getting into a health professions school. Our immediate goals are to provide these resources to our conference participants in order to facilitate a successful application process and emphasize the dire need of strong and innovative leaders to serve in medically underserved communities.

Are YOU ready to date the girl of your dreams?
Whether you’re a newbie to dating, or have been studying the art of attraction for years, you’ve likely come to this page for one reason: 
YOU WANT MORE SUCCESS WITH WOMEN.
 
At the ABCs of Attraction, this is our ONE AND ONLY goal for our students. 
By signing up for our bootcamp, we GUARANTEE that you will get:


Exclusive and field tested tactics, routines, and stories that utilize being Asian (or other) to YOUR ADVANTAGE for Interracial Dating &amp; Pick-up SUCCESS!
30 hours worth of training over 3 days and 3 nights
The workshop section has four and five hours of seminars, lectures, &amp; intsense interactive drills
A workbook over 100 pages that will give you EVERYTHING that you need to make meeting women EASY
A detailed understanding of the unique, intuitive, and easy to understand and implement ABCs Structure: 

The ONLY HOLISTIC mind &amp; body form of pick-up that combines:

Inner Game (10 Pillars of Strength &amp; Lifestyle) 
Outer Game (Subcommunication &amp; Bodylanguage)
Verbal Attraction (Bantering &amp; Storytelling)



Then the fun starts!

Each evening, students head out to local hotspots with our instructors for a night of socializing with the kind of women they have only dreamed of before. 
Our 3:1 student – instructor ratio offers each ABCs student as much 1-on-1 help as they can handle. And after each in-field exercise is a debriefing session where students can get feedback on how they did. 
Often times, our students meet someone special during the bootcamp, which alone can be well worth the price of attending.

AND HERE IS THE BEST PART:
Head instructor JT the Asian Playboy does not belong to any large corporation, and is not interested in fly-by-night schemes. He is interested in YOUR SUCCESS, and has designed a program that keeps students in REGULAR contact with instructors through meetings and our internet boards. 
In other words, THIS IS NOT A ONE- WEEKEND THING. 
We have gotten tired of hearing stories where a guys takes a bootcamp at another company, gets some success, and then slowly loses his skills. THIS IS NOT TRUE INSTRUCTION, but a temporary fix.
After YEARS of teaching his own highly successful bootcamps, APB has designed a SPECIALIZED program of hardcore instruction combined with multiple follow up meetings. Our alumni have a chance to meet with their instructors even AFTER they graduate from the bootcamp.
We believe our students are a reflection of our company, and our goal is to assure that all of them are successful. Where other companies cut contact with students when the bootcamp ends, your bootcamp is an induction into a brotherhood of amateur and veteran social artists who truly want to help each other.
And guess what? WE DON’T CHARGE EXTRA FOR THE FOLLOW-UP REUNIONS.
This is not some scheme where we raised the prices of our programs.
 APB has chosen to offer FREE follow-up events because he is dedicated to seeing his students grow and become successful with women. Having learned from the best, APB understands that, while a bootcamp can skyrocket your success, follow up is essential to truly develop your social skills.
Here is what some students are saying about our program:

The ABCs of Attraction is one of the rare companies that offers programs like this, which is why we have had such a high student success rate. 
We view teaching as more than a method. We see it as a MOVEMENT of men learning how to properly socialize, interact and date women.
Now you can learn the A-F secrets of how to meet beautiful women and begin your own journey of personal improvement.
Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s time?
EMPOWER YOURSELF!

Phone Consultation Testimonial from The Karoake Closer from New York:  &quot;All I have to say is that the phone consultation is something that really sets APB’s bootcamp apart from all those other programs out there. I mean, who else is going to give you that kind of personalized attention before you even start the program? And Quality is one of the wisest guys out there when it comes to this stuff. He was able to answer any question I could think of. Thing is- he actually cares to answer your questions- it’s not like he’s just waiting for the time to run out.   Getting to the actual phone call- Quality is a cool bro who really takes the time to assess where you’re at and what areas you might need help in. It started off as a sort of diagnostic where Quality asked what my sticking points were and where I might need some help. I mentioned that I was new to the community, so he basically had to go through everything with me. He really took the time to go through the ABC’s of Attraction system with me step by step, which was helpful going into the bootcamp because it gave me an overview of what I was going to learn and how everything fit together. It also allowed me to see where I might need to spend my time going over sticking points.   For me specifically, escalation and closing are especially difficult. Quality was able to show me a few pointers and techniques to really escalate the kino and finally extract the girls.   My phone call went over an hour, and Quality really took the time to answer my questions. I was only able to do one day of the bootcamp this time, but the personal attention I got from the coaches, starting with the phone consultation, was one of the main reasons for signing up IMMEDIATELY to do the next bootcamp.   I had to give a shout out to Quality for the awesome advice and attention- sorry this report is coming so late bro!

Nightly Coaching Program -
     Perfect for Alumni students looking to get a maintenance tune-up and also great for new-comers looking to get a quick assessment on the current status of their game.
   &quot;Sarging with the Asian Playboy as an ongoing experience has really changed my life. The Bootcamps really hammer it out as far as your game goes, but getting nightly coaching periodically helps keep my game sharp. When you&#39;re in field, with the music blaring, people walking everywhere, and you anxiety building, it&#39;s really tough to tell what you&#39;re doing well and what you&#39;re not. It&#39;s just really helpful having a professional set of eyes evaluating you game&quot;  - Kevin Feng" class="notranslateBecome a better photographer and stop using your camera&#39;s &#34;Auto&#34; mode in 1 evening.

Have you ever wondered why after spending hundreds of dollars on the latest cameras you still can&#39;t get photos you&#39;re really proud of? We&#39;re not talking about the party snapshots you post on Facebook, but stunning landscapes that can be considered fine art and grab attention for longer than 5 seconds.
Learn to capture beautiful photos and never miss a memory again.
This 3 hour class is a crash course in digital photography. Taught in our West Hollywood studio in small groups of 15 students), you&#39;ll learn what all those knobs and dials on your DSLR do, the settings to use in any lighting condition, and even what kind of camera to buy if you don&#39;t already have one. You&#39;ll understand concepts like exposure, aperture, depth of field and shutter speed, and probably never want to use the &#34;automatic mode&#34; again.
No prior experience or camera equipment is necessary to attend. Just a desire to improve your photography skills. Take this class for yourself or gift it to a friend who&#39;s got a photographic itch to scratch.
Frequently Asked Questions


Who are you guys?
We&#39;re a team of 3 passionate photographers (Lindsay, William and Mel) who have taught this class since Fall 2010. Our professional experience includes landscape, fine art, architecture, food and fashion photography. Browse our main website to view some of our work.


What&#39;s the class schedule?
This is a 3 hour class held most Saturdays and Sundays from 10am-1pm or 3pm-6pm. It&#39;s also offered on some weeknights (typically Wednesdays) from 7pm-10pm. The dates are scheduled approximately 1 month in advance, and more dates are added every few weeks.


What&#39;s the format of this class?
It&#39;s a group class held in an indoor classroom setting in groups of around 15 students.


I already have some photography experience from high school, or just from playing with my camera. Will this class be useful for me?
Yes, it could be a good refresher for you to consolidate all the bits and pieces of knowledge you&#39;ve picked up over the years. You&#39;ll also find plenty of inspiration (in the form of some beautiful photos) to get back into photography if you haven&#39;t done it in a while. You get to ask any burning questions to a professional photographer. And it&#39;s a great way to spend an afternoon in the company of other beginners and amateurs. However, if you already have a good handle on things like shutter speed, aperture, ISO and manual mode, this class is probably going to be too basic for you.


What kind of camera do I need to attend this class?
Bring whichever camera you currently own. No need to buy anything special or fancy for this class. We explain the differences between simple point &amp; shoot cameras and DSLRs, so you&#39;ll be better informed about what kind of camera to buy, should you decide to upgrade your current one.


What else should I bring to class?
Anything you need to take notes on (pen, paper, iPad, laptop etc) and a snack or drink.


Have more questions? Please shoot us an email for a quick response (faster than calling, leaving a voicemail and waiting to hear back).

 LA Web Professionals Group August 2012 Meeting - 
Instant, Expressive and Awesome Painting and Illustration in Photoshop, featuring Jack Davis
Thursday August 9, 2012 - 6:15 PM - 9:30 PM
LOCATION: ING Direct Cafe - http://www.facebook.com/INGDIRECTLA11175 Santa Monica Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90025
FREE PARKING::REFRESHMENTS::NETWORKING::DOOR PRIZES

   

Can you REALLY paint traditional media convincingly in Photoshop (especially in the new CS6)? Absolutely YES! Easily? YES! Quickly? Your head will spin! To expressively paint, where your emotion, as well as your mind, get to come out and play, is one of life’s greatest pleasures. Especially when you can use a computer, a Wacom tablet and Photoshop to do all the laborious set up (and clean up!) that is typically involved with traditional medias like oils, watercolors or even pastels. All of these different media types will be demonstrated and simulated in this evening seminar led by award winning designer and artist/illustrator Jack Davis (who knows a thing or two about Photoshop as well ;).
 
And all these projects will start with a photograph - yes, Jack will be cloning sheep that night! These photographs (once first “enhanced” in Photoshop&#39;s Adobe Camera Raw) will be the “palette” of colors, tones and shapes that we will use in creating the masterpieces. And that means for these techniques no expert drawing skills are needed - though certainly if you can paint and draw traditionally then you will have an advantage when it comes to creatively “drawing outside the lines”! Come ready to be trained, entertained and inspired! 

 
6:15 PM – Doors Open (Please don&#39;t arrive before 6:15)

&#34;If you&#39;re in the Los Angeles area, I highly recommend attending this series of classes.  Brought to you by two excellent filmmakers and instructors, Mark Stolaroff and Tom Provost, you really can&#39;t go wrong.&#34; - Huffington Post
&#34;Every producer should take your classes before taking on a film. These classes are beneficial not just for writers or directors but for anyone who works with or has a love for movies.&#34; - Andy Henderson
&#34;This was an excellent class. It is very rare that you can talk to a filmmaker so openly about every aspect of production and really delve into the film. Especially one who has so much knowledge of film as Tom does.&#34; - Alden Anderson

No Budget Film School presents &#34;Cinema Language,&#34; four courses rolled into a single weekend.  A departure from previous No Budget Film School courses that have concentrated solely on no-budget production, &#34;Cinema Language&#34; is an intensive and highly entertaining exploration of the art of cinema.  The kind of instruction usually found only in expensive film schools, these tenets of film language are some of the most cost-effective ways to improve the quality of a production no matter what the budget.  Whether you&#39;re spending $100 million or $100, you&#39;re going to be pointing your camera at something.  “Cinema Language” is a practical exploration of how to get the most out of what you shoot, independent of budget. 
These classes are taught by filmmaker and professor (Pepperdine University) Tom Provost, writer/director of the award-winning Lionsgate feature The Presence,  (see bio below) at Raleigh Studios&#39; Chaplin Theater, from 9am to 6pm, on August 11th &amp; 12th.  Single day tickets are also available for each day. Tuition includes complimentary refreshments and class materials.

&#34;Cinema Language&#34; is being taught alongside Mark Stolaroff&#39;s famed no-budget filmmaking class &#34;The Art &amp; Science of No-Budget Filmmaking,&#34; which takes place the weekend prior, August 4th &amp; 5th.  You can take each class separately, or together and save.  For more information on &#34;Cinema Language,&#34; see below.  For more information on &#34;The Art &amp; Science of No-Budget Filmmaking,&#34; visit the Art &amp; Science of No-Budget Filmmaking Eventbrite page.  The two weekend, four-day bundle can be purchased on this page or on the Art &amp; Science page.  A special &#34;gift bag&#34; of free goodies will be provided to attendees who take all four days.

DAY ONE - SATURDAY, AUGUST 11, 2012
Morning Session:  Course 103: &#34;Mastering Film Grammar&#34;
&#34;You gave me a whole new appreciation for visual storytelling. Your presentations will forever have an impact on my own writing and storytelling.&#34; - Joe Coddington

&#34;Mastering Film Grammar&#34; covers the specific strengths of the motion picture medium. What are the artistic elements that make up a film, and how do they work together to create a singular, multi-sensory experience?  Instructor Provost will explore the colors, shots, shapes, symbols, lines, shadows, and sounds that prompt specific emotions and make up the extremely visual and aural art that is the motion picture.  Framing, moving, editing and lighting the image, depth of field, POV, score and source music, sound effects:  these are the elements of the language of cinema, and we as filmmakers make creative decisions based on these elements no matter the budget of our projects. 
The course dives into classical film grammar, examining how to use it properly and then how it can be twisted to great effect.  The course also covers specific examples of how to use Frame, Light, Shadow, Color, Sound, and Editing, with over 100 clips and screen shots from various movies to illustrate and illuminate.  Whether you are a writer, director, producer, or just a film buff, this extremely entertaining class will expand your knowledge of the craft of filmmaking as well as help inspire and prepare you for your next feature project.  

Suggested Homework Assignment
Watch  All That Jazz  (1979 dir. Bob Fosse);  Notorious  (1946  dir. Alfred Hitchcock)

Afternoon Session:  Course 204:  &#34;From Script to Screen&#34;
&#34;The most innovative ghost story I&#39;ve ever seen...Tom Provost gives a clinic on storytelling through a lens of a camera.&#34; - Bruce Kooken (review of The Presence for HorrorNews.net)
&#34;Aesthetically riveting. Without a doubt one of the most unique genre entries to be released this year.&#34; - Joseph Airdo (review of The Presence for the Phoenix Daily News)
&#34;Exuding a sinister serenity that brings to mind Stanley Kubrick&#39;s &#39;The Shining,&#39; &#39;The Presence&#39; is one of those films that linger with you days after viewing.&#34; - Nathan Page (review of The Presence for the Cleveland Plain Dealer)

Writer/Director Provost discusses the process of traveling from script to final edited product of his feature The Presence, which stars Oscar Winner Mira Sorvino, Golden Globe Nominee Justin Kirk and Shane West. The film was released last fall by Lionsgate.  This will be a candid, insightful dissection of the filmmaking process, examining a recently-completed feature that was chosen as the opening or closing night film at a variety of festivals, winning various Best Film, Best Director and Best Cinematographer awards as well.  Students will read the first act of the screenplay as homework before attending the class, and then watch the complete film in the afternoon. 
Following the screening, Provost will cover extensively how he and his creative team worked to bring what was on paper to life, given the typical compromises and considerations of budget, time, personnel issues, weather, and planning.  Particular focus will be placed on what &#34;went wrong&#34; on the set, as well as what changed from the script and why.  The discussion will also include the &#34;writing&#34; that went on in the editing room as the film took shape and became something apart from the shooting script.  Specific clips and production stills will be used to illustrate the various decisions made on the set and after.  
&#34;From Script To Screen&#34; is an extremely frank and revealing discussion about the realities every filmmaker faces whatever the budget, offering filmmakers a rare insider&#39;s look at just how a movie comes to fruition. Students will have an open forum with the filmmaker regarding their thoughts and questions on the movie and the filmmaking process.
 
Suggested Homework Assignment
Read the first 30 pages of The Presence
 
NOTE ON HOMEWORK:  Once enrolled, students will receive the pages to read along with an email from Tom Provost.  All of the movies suggested for viewing before the seminar are available on Netflix, some on iTunes as well.

&#34;A brilliant debut film...unlike anything you&#39;ve ever seen...surprising at every turn.&#34; - DAIFF Daily News
&#34;One of the best movies I&#39;ve seen all year...a visual an audio feast.&#34; - Bitterbalcony.com
&#34;Visually stunning...will have you talking for hours...it&#39;s awesome.&#34; - moviebuzzers.com

DAY TWO - SUNDAY, AUGUST 12, 2012
Morning Session:  Course 104:  &#34;Introducing Your Character&#34;
&#34;You have unique insight on form and character that I will incorporate into my own directing. And the class was extremely entertaining.&#34; - Julie Cohen

One of the most difficult things to do in any kind of story is quickly and efficiently set up a character...and in a manner that pays off further into the narrative. &#34;Introducing Your Character&#34; is an in-depth, intensive look at how filmmakers effectively reveal characters to the audience, whether in a straightforward or purposely misleading fashion. Using a variety of clips as well as John Dahl&#39;s retro thriller Red Rock West, the class examines numerous ways you can provide incisive information to your  audience, even in a single line or shot.  In the words of instructor Provost, &#34;This is a kick-ass class.” 

Suggested Homework Assignment 
Watch Red Rock West (1993, dir. John Dahl) 
Afternoon Session:  Course 105:  &#34;Disclosure of Information&#34;
 &#34;The information you presented was just incredible. It will have a profound effect on how I approach my own stories.&#34; - Alice Garcia

“Disclosure of Information” is the essence of storytelling. Every single choice you make in storytelling/filmmaking reveals information to the audience. How to do it, when and why to do it, what the effect will be on your audience--all are determined by the manner in which you disclose each and every piece of information in your script. 
While the entire weekend in essence is an exploration of how to disclose information, this class looks in-depth at the myriad choices a filmmaker has--right and wrong--and how to master those choices to create the most effective experience for the audience possible. Clips from various films such as Jaws, Blood Simple, and Carrie will be used, as well as intensive explorations of two Hitchcock classics, North by Northwest and Psycho. 
Suggested Homework Assignment 
Watch North By Northwest and Psycho (1959/1960, dir. Alfred Hitchcock) 
 
MORE TESTIMONIALS FOR TOM PROVOST:
&#34;Your class on form and construction of image is of the utmost importance and, as a director, to say it affected my own work in a profound way would be an understatement.&#34; - Bill Garrett
&#34;A very candid, humble, and talented guy! Loved the class!&#34; - Bart Baggett
&#34;I had such a good time!!! It was wonderful!&#34; - Joy Young

ABOUT THE INSTRUCTOR:
Tom Provost has enjoyed a varied and successful career in the entertainment industry as an author, screenwriter, editor, director, producer, actor, and instructor.  Before graduating from The University of Texas in Austin&#39;s prestigious Plan II honors program with an emphasis in film, he wrote and directed several shorts and authored a published thesis on director Alfred Hitchcock.  He then moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career.  After landing several parts in film and TV, including a recurring role on Steven Spielberg&#39;s SeaQuest DSV, Provost took up editing, learning the Avid system just as non-linear editing was beginning to make its way on the scene.  After editing short films and a couple of features, he worked for several years cutting  and producing award winning promos for the WB and Bravo Television Networks.  
During this time he was hired to adapt a script for Morgan Freeman&#39;s production company, Revelations, a screenplay eventually made into the film Under Suspicion starring Freeman and Gene Hackman, directed by Stephen Hopkins. The screenplay was nominated for an Edgar Award.  This lead to work as a script doctor, where his ability to shape story has been highly prized. Provost&#39;s feature directorial debut The Presence, (www.thepresencemovie.com), which he also wrote, was released by Lionsgate Films in Fall 2011.  The inventive ghost story/modern-day gothic romance stars Academy Award-winning actress Mira Sorvino (Mighty Aphrodite), Shane West (ER), Golden Globe Nominee Justin Kirk (Weeds), and Tony Curan (Pearl Harbor, Gladiator).  In addition to directing commercials and editing reality TV (The Bachelor, The Apprentice [Emmy nominated], and several others), Provost has been a popular film instructor at a variety of venues all over the country for many years.

While other training organizations were focusing on &#34;What to do once you get in&#34;, Dialexis realized that the &#34;Real Problem&#34; facing sales people was &#34;How To Get In!&#34; Salespeople can&#39;t sell what you want them to sell if they can&#39;t get in. For 15 years, Dialexis relentlessly pursued professional strategies that would provide salespeople with the &#34;key techniques&#34; necessary for making C-Level Contact while making fewer initial calls. We knew that if we were successful, we would have a differentiator that would jolt the selling world.
The results were astounding, organizations involved in the program professionally penetrated gatekeeper blockades in the high range of 80% to 90% of every call made. We knew then we really had something. We literally discovered techniques that would create first call access when making live contact on the street or the telephone. The SOAR (Surge Of Accelerating Revenue) program was born. Today, organizations throughout the world are introducing SOAR to their sales force and changing the way contact is made. They are enjoying substantial ROI and are providing a new level of solutions for their sales team. 1 Day SOAR LIVE! Objective

 *What is a DSLR camera?DSLR stands for Digital Single-Lens Reflex. DSLR models typically offer interchangeable lenses, full manual controls, external flash units, and through-the-lens (TTL) viewfinders. They are usually large models and they closely resemble 35mm film cameras with handgrips and large lens housings.If you do not have a DSLR camera please consider taking Understanding Your Digital Camera with Art Ramirez.Instructor: Jenny Roberts, C.A.R. National Products Adoption ManagerThe Venice based community organization A Sustainable Kitchen is launching its new kids program with Seeds For Sprouts. a series of four planting workshops for ‘budding’ gardeners ages 6-10 on the Patio at Surfas in Culver City.  A Sustainable Kitchen believes all kids should know where food really comes from, not just the grocery store, and have the opportunity to experience the joy and wonder that comes from growing something from seed to plate. At each workshop each child will have a chance to plant three different types of herb or vegetable seeds in compostable ‘starter cups’. There will also be more mature sprouts and plants on hand so they can see what they plant will look like as it grows. There will also be at least one of the actual herb or vegetable at each workshop, so they can taste what they will be growing, if they want. Printed instructions for basic care will be provided. If your child attends all four workshops, with a little water, sunlight and loving care, they will have their own mini edible garden by the end of Summer. The Seeds for Sprouts workshops will also take place on the Surfas patio Thursday mornings July 12, 2012,  July 26, 2012, August 9, 2012 and August 23 from 8:30- 9:15am. The workshops are free and open to the public. A child can attend one, several or all of them, but there are only 18 spaces in each workshop so you must sign-up and register for each one. (Please note: if your child is participating in the Piccolo Chef cooking camps, these workshops coordinate with their camps for 6-10 year olds.)

However, there is tremendous diversity in how ABA is implemented, making it extremely difficult for parents and professionals to know what to look for in a quality program. This workshop clarifies the essential foundational elements of ABA and separates dogma from philosophy and fact. Attendees will leave with an understanding of the critical program components necessary to deal with challenging behaviors, promote learning skills and maximize student progress.
 
Topics will Include:
 
 - Our Current Understanding of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)
- Contemporary ABA and its Evolution 
- What Helps and What Interferes with Progress
- Changing our Expectations for Individuals with ASD
-How to Escalate Rate of Student Learning

This is the perfect forum for anyone starting or growing a  business, looking to make a significant career change or simply wants to explore the possibilities in living a powerful and fulfilled life! Since the 2008 Obama campaign, political strategist the world over have sought to learn from and replicate its successful use of social media. Fast forward to 2012, social media tools have emerged as the great equalizer when used effectively in competitive political races.  
The power of social media in political campaigns is undeniable and astounding. Precisely target voters based on key demographic data, such as a Latina college graduate between the age of 36 and 40 with school-age children who lives in zip code 90027. Know what voters are saying based on the equivalent of a 24/7 focus group in real-time.  Amplify your call to action with digital media that reaches target populations when and where they’re most likely to see it….And that’s just the low-hanging fruit.
This all-day, first-of-its-kind social media training will equip campaign leaders with proven and practical strategies in the following subjects:

The World of Social Media – Get the skinny on each of the major social media platforms with real-life examples of how they’re successfully used by political campaigns; 


I Want Your Vote! – Learn best practices – and what not to do – in engaging target populations across platforms.  This section will include the most common mistakes made by candidates using digital and social media to reach voters, and how to avoid them; 


From Online to IRL – Once we’ve set the table on the latest in social media, the rest of the training will focus on tips &amp; tricks on seamlessly integrating your campaign’s digital and communications strategy from online to IRL (social media shorthand for ‘in real life’).  We’ll review the key aspects of a social media plan, which will include how and where to engage specific communities (e.g. women, LGBT, Jewish), as well as free and cost-effective social media tools that your campaign will need to grow its online community and maximize message control. In addition, learn how to use social media tools to monitor, measure, and respond to anything about your candidate in real-time; 


Please Give – Social media is a game changer for political fundraising.  We’ll examine evidence-based models on digital and social media techniques that are proven to lower the barriers to giving and how your campaign can replicate them in no time. We’ll review best practices in email appeals, social media tools for political contributions, mobile credit card readers for easier IRL contributions, newly approved text donation platforms, and much more; and, 


#GOTV2.0 – Now more than ever, social and mobile will play key roles in getting out the vote on Election Day.  We’ll take a deep dive into emerging technologies, such as mobile apps for political campaigns, that will help your campaign secure the winning edge.

 The Burbank Fire Department will be conducting the Fall 2012 Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) training starting on Saturday September 29th.  The training is taught in 8 modules over four Saturdays (non-consecutive), the dates are: Saturday September 29th (9:00 AM to 4:30 PM), Saturday October 6th (9:30 AM to 4:30 PM), Saturday October 20th (9:30 AM to 4:30 PM) and Saturday October 27th (9:30 AM to 4:30 PM).  Attendance at all 8 modules (all 4 days) is required to complete the class; however, if you miss any modules due to life&#39;s hectic schedule, you can make up the modules in future Burbank CERT classes.
 
There is a $50 partially refundable fee for the class.  This fee covers the expense of the CERT backpack (with starter equipment), Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and a CERT manual all of which are yours to keep at the end of the class.  Upon successful completion of the Burbank CERT class, the graduate will receive a $20 partial refund of their fee.  If the graduate goes on to join the Burbank Fire Corps Program (www.burbankfirecorps.org), they will receive an additional $20 partial refund.  For additional information regarding the partial refund or missing class dates, please scroll down to our question and answer area.
 
To register electronically and paying by credit card, click the green “order now” button above.  If you are paying by cash or check at that door, please email cert@burbankfirecorps.org to RSVP and reserve a spot.  Uncertain if you can attend, walk-ins are welcome to register the first day of class at 9:00 AM (please note only cash or check payments can be processed for walk-in and pay at the door options).

Q: $20 refund for successful completion? Cool! But what is a “successful” completion?
A: To be eligible for the $20 partial refund, the student must successfully attend and complete all modules of the contiguous CERT class.  Students that miss any module can make up that module in a future class and receive their certificate of completion, but will not be eligible for the partial refund.  Applications for partial refund must be submitted in person on the final day of class.

Q:  I can already tell I’m going to be a big volunteer!  How do I get the second $20 refund?
A: Graduates that are eligible to join the Burbank Fire Corps Volunteer Program within 30 days of completion of the CERT class, and remain an active member for at least 6 months, are eligible for an additional $20 partial refund.  Applications for partial refund must be submitted in person on the final day of class.

Q: I’m suffering an old knee injury, but CERT seems really cool.  Is there any way I can make it through the class?
A: Yes.  The idea of CERT training is to build preparedness and response capacity in you.  While there is definitely a physical aspect to the class, it scales with your own abilities – and it’s one of the reasons we give so much hands-on time in class.

Q:  If I couldn’t do something because of that knee injury, like victim extrication, am I disqualified from that $20 partial refund for completion?
A:  No. There are roles for everybody in CERT, including directing those that are untrained.  As long as student has perfect attendance, they qualify for the partial refund.

Q:  What if I am registered but miss the first day of class?
A:  You can show up to any of the remaining class dates, you will just need to make up the missed classes during a future Burbank CERT class in order to receive are certificate of completion (note, you will not be eligible for the partial refund).

Q:  What if I am unable to attend, am I eligible for a refund?
A:  If you pre-registered and paid by credit card, you must cancel and request a refund via eventbrite no later than midnight Wednesday Sept. 26th. We cannot issue refunds past that time.  If you paid by credit card and miss entire series of class dates, and missed the cutoff to cancel and request a refund, your $50 fee will be credited to a future Burbank CERT class which starts within 12 months of the scheduled start date of your class.Greetings!

The Ultimate Pick Up Personal Training 
Three-Month Plan is now here!
Month OneWeek One: Three-day/night, discounted bootcamp with head instructorWeek Two: Two 4-hour sessions with coach**Week Three: One personal 4-hour session with head instructorWeek Four: Two 4-hour sessions with coachBONUS: 1 phone consultation with a coachTotal: 51 Training Hours
Month TwoWeek One: One personal 4-hour session with head instructorWeek Two: Two 4-hour sessions with coach**Week Three: One personal 4-hour session with head instructorWeek Four: Two 4-hour sessions with coachBONUS: 4 field report critiques (not cumulative)Total: 28 Training Hours 
Month ThreeWeek One: One personal 4-hour session with head instructorWeek Two: Two 4-hour sessions with coach**Week Three: One personal 4-hour session with head instructorWeek Four: Two 4-hour sessions with coachBONUS: 4 field report critiques (not cumulative)Total: 28 Training Hours
The plan covers all aspects of the learning process. First and foremost, the bootcamp is an absolute necessity. The classroom portion (15+ hours) helps familiarize the student with the terms and delivers the tools to get laid as quickly as possible. The in-field sessions allow the instructor and coaches to oversee the initial execution of all that&#39;s been taught and provide feedback and a (sometimes) friendly push if need be. The student will learn the holistic structure of the ABC method, be drilled in specific areas and have in-field practice each night of the three days giving a rock-solid foundation from which to grow as thoroughly as possible during his self-betterment journey. In addition (and progress-dependent), the client will be taught more advanced techniques specifically geared towards shortening the time between the meeting and the mating, building stronger connections with women and establishing quality social circles. Topics like internet, text and phone game will be covered as well as various missions given to keep the student on-task, motivated and growing. In essence, if time and motivation allows, the student will learn everything the instructor and coach have to teach.  The follow-up in-field training will allow both the head instructor and coach(es) to personally analyze the client&#39;s strengths and weaknesses, as well as his progress, and to deliver on-the-spot suggestions and methods for success. The client will also be held responsible to keep up his expected responsibilities including, but not limited to, keeping an online journal, writing down a mission statement, fashion shopping, weekly/monthly missions, personal hygeine, hair care, reading assignments, watching assignments and other exercises that the trainer deems necessary.In essence, the program depicted above is a personalized journey catered in the most specific and intensive way to a client&#39;s particular style of learning and can address every shortcoming and limiting belief that presents itself. There is no better way to learn than to have a vast bank of wealth presented to you at whatever speed you find most suitable and then to have a personal coach on your side to see that you&#39;re making the most of that information. Think of it like a Pick Up Personal Trainer. This program will boost your confidence, your social calibration and make you unstoppable with women.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Q: Is the starter bootcamp another bootcamp in addition to the required bootcamp?A: No, the starter bootcamp is the same bootcamp format as the special bootcamp, but it is more affordable and there is often a higher student:teacher ratio available.
However, APB&#39;s infield sessions are dictated by his availability, although at least one night session is guaranteed.
All other field training is handled by APB&#39;s hand picked and personally trained, Certified ABCs coaches who have gone through 500 hours of live training.Q: Are all the coaching sessions in field?A: Not all of the coaching sessions are in-field. Depending on the student&#39;s progress, there may be lectures on phone/text game, storytelling, dominance, event organizing, social circle expansion, relationship maintenance, etc. If a student is having particularly tough time with the basics, the better part of the time will be spent in-field rehearsing the basics before moving on. Q: If so, is it assumed the student has to pay for the coaches (or their own) travel costs?A: Both the client and the coach will be responsible for their own travel expenses in the Los Angeles area. A different rate will apply to the training cost in areas outside of Los Angeles. The only costs will be taking care of cover and taxi fare.Q: What is the difference between this bootcamp and the weekend bootcamps?A: Bootcamps are very important and are a great standalone product (as has been proven by the past 4 years of success for The ABCs of Attraction). These personal, monthlong training sessions are meant to be a more specific training program catered to an individual interested in the most thorough, hands-on training possible. While the weekend bootcamps offer a great wealth of knowledge and practice (and are prescribed for beginners because of their immeasurable value), ongoing coaching tunes the finer points of game and offers all the knowledge that the coach possesses.Q: Before I consider this program, I would like clarification: Will the 4 hour sessions (with a coach or head instructor) be classroom sessions or will they be infield sessions at night time?A: As mentioned before, the program will depend greatly on the progress of the student and his personal preference. Some students may rather sit over coffee and discuss Text Game and some may rather go to a club and work on building comfort. Remember, we&#39;re here for you and the advantages of the Personal Training program are that we can cater to your needs. Q: What happens if I want all field training, but the coach recommends more drills &amp; lectures?A: Well, your training is personalized to you and we will cater to your needs as much as possible. However, do realize that the reason your trainer is recommending a certain curriculum is that he detects a defiency that can be fixed with further training. Of course, if you are still conflicted about following your trainer&#39;s recommendation, then the head instructor will make the final mediation.
Q: Is it appropriate for a beginner like me?A: In our first, inaugrual 12 Weeks of Fury program, one of our students had been in the Community for only 3 months and who had his first kiss at the age of 23. If that doesn&#39;t qualify him as a beginner, then I don&#39;t know who does. And during the Fury Starter Bootcamp, he fully, romantically, and sexually connected with a woman on just the SECOND NIGHT OF BOOTCAMP. Trust us, we can help ANYONE and- yes- that includes YOU!Q: How much pre-program preparation do I have to do?A: The Pre-Program stuff is just like all the other pre-bootcamp homework. Basic, but thorough. It will take work, but nothing incredibly taxing.Q: How does it work around the holiday season?A: The advantage of the program is that the personal attention is catered in just that way, personally. We&#39;re not a huge corporation with big strict attendance policies; we can make anything work for anybody. That&#39;s our job.Q: How much time per week do I have to devote to it? Normally I have only the weekends free. Will it consume my entire weekend, every weekend?A: After the three-day bootcamp, there is a 2-1-2 training session schedule. It&#39;s explained very thoroughly on the event description page at http://12weeksoffury.eventbrite.com/ but the short answer is: You can devote as much time as you want to the program. This is YOUR life and YOUR desire to improve that we&#39;re working with. If you want to make the time to improve, then we can work with it. Both Gareth and APB sarged 4 to 6 nights a row back in basic training, but obviously most people cannot make that huge a time commitment. But that&#39;s why we&#39;re here, to accelerate your growth through all the growing pains so that you learn- and sarge- more efficiently. Q: How can it be that it lasts so much longer than a bootcamp (12 weeks versus one weekend), but only costs about twice as much? Is the 12 weeks basically equivalent to three back-to-back bootcamps?A: This is the pilot program which we&#39;ve just started. The price is definitely going to go up in the future. But for right now, all those lucky students who decide to sign up, get the benefit of a reduced price while we work out the kinks that naturally comes with creating a new, customized training program. Also, Asian Playboy does not teach all the sessions. Refer to the 2-1-2 training sessions in the 12 Weeks of Fury course description to see the breakdown.

from REFUsol Distributed Solar PV Experts
Europe has already embraced the distributed approach and a decentralized design using string inverters is gaining popularity throughout the United States. Among string inverters, transformerless (TL) inverters offer several advantages not present in their transformer-based counterparts regardless of their size, such as higher efficiency, lighter weight and more compact form factor. In this training you will earn how the PV array is broken up into smaller sub-arrays, each with its own TL inverter and, therefore, its own MPPT tracking system. Time and cost are further saved since most TL inverters have a built-in DC fused combiner and disconnect, equipment which is typically needed with central inverters. Finally, maintenance and servicing is much easier and inexpensive with the decentralized concept. If there is a problem with one of the string inverters, it can be easily exchanged for a new one in the field reducing loss. 
What will be covered in the training: 
1. Applications
   - A few applications ranging from carports to Utility Scale
2. Centralized vs Decentralized approach
3. Overview of the Inverter
   - Features/Benefits
   - Protection Features 
   - Inverter Spec Sheet 
   - Connection box and components
4. Installation of Inverters
   - Clearances &amp; Cable connections
   - Requirements of cables and ungrounded array
5. Operation
   - Inputs &amp; Outputs
6. Monitoring
   - Control Panel
   - Data Logger
   - Communication Ports (RS485/Ethernet)
7. Basic Troubleshooting
   - Typical DC Fault
   - Typical AC Faults
8. Maintenance
Breakfast and Lunch are included.The Sony FS100 &amp; FS700 Workshops are designed to be hands-on classes covering the various functions of Sony&#39;s newest NEX Super-35 cameras. You will gain a detailed understanding of the many features of the FS100 and FS700, including the menu system, camera operation, lens options, post-production workflow, and available accessories. Emphasis is on developing an understanding of the camera sensor, recording format, lens choice, and menu systems.

In the first day of the course, Abel trainers will give a full introduction to the FS100 and  700 cameras including: sensor specifics, recording formats, output options, menu systems, assignable functions, slow-motion, and basic color control. Topics covered on the first day of training will prepare attendees for topics covered on day two.
In the second day of the course, Abel trainers will demonstrate practical shooting examples, give an in-depth look at the camera’s picture profiles and explain the different gamma modes. We will also explore post production workflow techniques. This is a very hands-on day, where attendees will be able to develop and fully understand the complexities of creating a look with the FS100 and FS700 as well as working with AVCHD in post-production.
FS100 and FS700 owners are encouraged to attend both days of this workshop, but AbelCine offers the option to attend either day on its own.

PROCRASTINATION!
IT’S UP TO YOU!



Does procrastinating on projects keep you up at night? 
Do you get anxious every time you remember you haven’t started or completed a project?

Do you feel overwhelmed by these thoughts?



 
The truth is that each project, whether work related or personal can have the same response of procrastination.  The difference is your thoughts, emotions, or beliefs behind a project as to whether it gets completed, started and then forgotten or kept in an endless ‘planning’ phase. 
 
Let us lighten your load, join us on Thursday, August 9th for a two-hour workshop where Letty Garay and Jorge Raziel Ortiz will give you not only tools to help you get motivated, create a clear vision and get you moving toward your goal, but you will also have the opportunity to get intimate insights as to what may be holding you back. 
 
We offer results so that you transform your procrastination into completion and satisfaction!
 
IT’S UP TO YOU!
 

 


We look forward in seeing you there.

DISCOVERY
You’re a visionary.  You know it’s time for fundamental change in the world.  You know that our current way of living is destroying people and planet at a rate and scale that is simply not conducive to sustaining human life.

You’ve got gifts the world needs--ideas, solutions, innovations, networks, and resources.  You have passion in your heart, fire in your belly, and a burning desire to birth a new humanity and the systems and structures to support it.

You want a world that reflects our deepest truths and highest aspirations as human beings--one that can sustain all life and support a thriving new humanity.   You want this deeply, and yet you know you can’t do it alone.

We do, too.  That’s why we’ve created a perpetually dynamic world-building movement design that empowers change-makers to awaken and mobilize people everywhere to work coherently as One Family on One Planet realizing One Vision:  A world of peace, abundance, joy, and freedom for all.


Among us, we have the reason, vision, power, and technology to create an amazing New World.  All we have to do now is HARNESS and direct it all in common purpose.  As change-makers, we can facilitate that.

That’s precisely what this workshop is about. We are the ones we’re no longer waiting for.

OPPORTUNITY
This workshop is a special introduction to the Creating the New World world-building movement design for change agents and their communities.  Its purpose is to inspire, empower, and coherently mobilize change agents to lead personal, community, and planetary transformation and begin a global world-building movement. As a standalone workshop, it offers activities and tools for personal transformation, as well as opportunities for participants to apply their gifts and passions to a coherent way to create a bright future for humanity. As a preliminary component of the larger world-building movement it represents, the workshop is intended to orient, gather, and begin mobilizing people to literally create the New World. 

EMPOWERMENT
You’ll walk away with:

A new perspective and exciting vision for your life, community, and world;


A clear line of sight between a world in crisis and an amazing new one, and a viable way to mobilize people everywhere to get there;


A way to move your change efforts from awareness and inspiration to coherent, collaborative action;


Practical tools and powerful insights to fuel your personal and professional development as a change agent;


A template for integrating and leveraging your solutions to individual challenges into a cohesive whole system and implement them on a global scale;


A way to mobilize the hearts, minds, and resources of people and organizations in your community and everywhere to work coherently toward a shared vision;


A clear understanding of the connection between personal and planetary transformation;


Practical ways to take your life, projects, and community to a new level of aligned action;


Clarity about your power and role as a change agent in creating a bright future for yourself, your community, and your world;


A forward strategy for your next steps as an empowered world-builder;


Opportunities to lead, co-create, and be a part of a coherent world-building process in which regular people create an amazing New World; and


Hope for the future from knowing we have the reason, vision, power, and technology to create a thriving New World, AND a viable way to harness our collective energy for literally doing it.

          An important aspect of cultivating culture is rooted in the exchange of ideas.  However contentious these exchanges may be it is vital for the discernment of truth.  In recent years there have been trends in our culture to merely accept what has been taught and given to us through various mediums – classrooms, television, churches, the internet, etc.  However good these mediums of information and education can be, we want to follow in the steps of great thinkers and commit ourselves to the arduous work of discovering wisdom.  It is not in passivity that we find ourselves, but in the work mentioned above.  God, in his infinite wisdom, equipped his beloved creation with the faculties to discern truth – His truth, in order to draw nearer to Him.
          Thus, in our desire to live holistically as the imago dei,  Art House Local will provide a space (in your local community) to engage in discussion, be sharpened intellectually, and to be built up spiritually with others who desire to not just talk about ideas, but to implement them and live them out in order to bring about a more just, truth infused, creative world.

Course Description:
This presentation is designed to assist law enforcement professionals by the development of behavioral strategies to inoculate against loss of idealism and inappropriate behavior patterns. It will review the short and long-term effects on law enforcement officers on both the personal and professional aspects of their lives.The course will discuss how the initial enthusiasm and desire to professionally contribute can be transformed into negative cynicism, social distrust and hostility to the world at large that significantly impacts the professionals work performance, decision-making and ultimately over-all quality of life. The course will also review the impact on the children of law enforcement families in terms of school functioning and health. The goal of the course is to have the law enforcement professional review the potential impact the career causes in the personal life and to develop strategies for overall emotional survival.The strategies are designed to permit the professional to continue functioning effectively and ethically without “burning-out” and without resorting to emotional isolation from friends and colleagues.
The course addresses the dynamics that can transform within a matter of a few years, idealistic and committed officers/employees into cynical, angry individuals who begin having difficulties in both the personal and professional aspects of their lives. The course outlines the issues that can potentially see officers engaging in inappropriate behavior patterns and decision-making that leads to both administrative and can unfortunately in some officers criminal difficulties.The purpose of the class is to provide information that lets the special assignment officer see how the deterioration process can take place and what specific preventative strategies can be employed.
 
The goal of the course is to provide information that lets agencies keep officers committed and engaged in productive police work. The course also gives information to employees on how not to become a &#34;self-perceived victim&#34;, a descriptor for an officer or employee that spends inordinate amounts of time resenting and resisting organizational and supervisory directive, as well as, suffering unnecessary destruction in the personal dimensions of their life.
 
Experience tells us that most law enforcement agencies have to deal with inappropriate behavior on the part of some officers or employees who previously had exemplary records, yet we find that agencies typically do not offer training in attempting to preserve idealism, motivation and overall emotional survival for it’s employees.
 
This course is presented at all FBI LEEDS and Executive Development Institutes at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia.

Creating your first Data Warehouse can seem like an overwhelming task.
In this full day pre-conference seminar, you’ll learn the core skills required in Data Warehousing with practical examples and demos from real world situations.  For example, you’ll learn how to:

Design Dimensions and load them with T-SQL and SSIS.
Determine if Slowly Changing Type 1 and 2 Dimensions are needed and when to use each.
Load both SCD types using several accepted methods including T-SQL Merge, the SCD Wizard, and a free custom transformation.
Design the three basic types of Fact Tables and load them utilizing proven SSIS design patterns.
Create and use a Date Dimension to facilitate data analysis.
Set up and utilize a SSIS Framework to handle Package Configurations and Logging in both SSIS 2008R2 and 2012.
Configure the most important Control Flow Items such as the Execute SQL Task, Sequence and Looping Containers, and the Execute Package Task.
Extract from and Load into the most common database systems and file types.
Use the most important Data Flow Transformations such as Lookup, Fuzzy Lookup and Grouping, Conditional Split, as well as several free custom transformations that you absolutely need in your toolbox.
Quickly identify problematic fields in data sources and implement effective Data Cleansing strategies.
Performance tune SSIS to optimize your data warehouse loads.
Optimize data analysis by implementing best practices for indexes and constraints.
Avoid common pitfalls in the process so that you can get it right the first time.

This seminar will not be your typical, “This is BIDS and we’ll cover every task one at a time,” session.  Instead we’ll focus on the tasks you’ll regularly use, and on the core skills that you absolutely need to succeed in your Data Warehouse project.
David Stein is a Senior Business Intelligence Consultant with WaveTwo in Irving, TX.  He’s worked in SQL Server Business Intelligence for almost a decade.  He’s designed Data Warehouses from scratch as well as saved projects in serious jeopardy.
He is also very active in the community, having spoken at PASS events at all levels, including the PASS Summit, SQL Rally, and at numerous SQL Saturday events and user groups.  He’s also given multi-day pre-conference seminars at third party events regarding Microsoft Business Intelligence.

Abstract
If you have ever worked with Entity Framework, even if you&#39;re doing Entity Framework Code First, you are almost certainly doing it wrong. While Entity Framework is a wonderful framework, it doesn&#39;t automatically force you into the correct patterns of use – especially if you&#39;re interested in isolation and testability.
This talk will review the concepts of both the Repository Pattern and the Specification Pattern and demonstrate how to implement them in Entity Framework.

 Join us on August 10th for our next Innovation Games® for Agile Teams course.

August 10th, 2012
Dallas, TX Area
Venue: Sabre Holdings
9:00 am-5:00 pm
Max class capacity: 25

 
 
 
Description:
Innovation Games® are serious games that can be used to deliver cost-effective market research for Agile teams and super-charge the product planning process. Based on the book of the same name by Luke Hohmann, Innovation Games® power innovation by enabling you to better understand your customers.
This course will help you gain a better understanding of how to apply these games within the context of an Agile development process. While there is a lot to love about Agile development, many practices can get pretty tiresome. Retrospectives stop working when teams become bored with answering the same three questions (“what worked, what didn’t work, what should we change?”). Prioritizing a product backlog in a single meeting before, or during, release planning using a spreadsheet isn’t very engaging. Developing and presenting a product roadmap using PowerPoint gets pretty old, especially when you can’t find a way to show the growth in functionality of your product.
 
Key Learnings:
In this course, we will show how Innovation Games® can be used to improve many of the practices that are common in Agile teams. Beginning with an overview of Innovation Games, you will learn how to:

Identify customer requirements for an ideal product through Product Box
Improve retrospectives with Speed Boat
Prioritize your backlog through the online game Buy a Feature Online
Plan a successful project through the game Remember the Future
Develop better release plans with Prune the Product Tree
Understand product usage with Me and My Shadow and Start Your Day

Agile should be fun! And when you integrate the games described in this class into your Agile practice, it will be.
 
Target Audience

All members of Agile teams with a focus on product planning, product development and product management.
Anyone who wishes to create more innovative product and service offerings.

 
Format/Duration
One day of instructor-led, interactive training
 
Benefits
Upon completing this course participants will have played several Innovation Games that they can use to work together as a team and directly with customers to better understand their needs. They will also have reference materials to additional techniques beyond the ones used in the presentation.
 
Content Outline

Discussion of Innovation Games and Market Research
Planning, playing, and post-processing Innovation Games
Multiple case studies and game play
Review and shared discussion; helping participants plan their adoption of these techniques

 
Theory of Instruction
The course is guided by a “learning by doing” model of education based on the Innovation Games® “Know-Do-Have” model of course design:

What participants will know after taking the class.
What participants will do during the class to reinforce key concepts.
What participants will have after the seminar to promote further practice and study.

 
Prerequisites
Although not strictly required, it is helpful if participants read the book Innovation Games®: Creating Breakthrough Products Through Collaborative Play before the course.
 
Materials

Copy of the book Innovation Games®: Creating Breakthrough Products Through Collaborative Play
Presentation in soft and hard copy
A variety of handouts used to stimulate thinking and apply the materials
Case studies

 
Instructor
Jeff Brantley is a product guy: a no-nonsense, git ‘er done, product guy. But building great products and services is a team sport and all your internal teams should be contributing to the innovation pipeline (engineering, sales, marketing, customers). Your product leadership toolkit should include Innovation Games and Jeff Brantley can help you learn how to use them to open up the innovation box. Don’t ask “What do you think we should build?” Instead ask them, “Do you want to play a game?”SHOULD I INCORPORATE? • 2 hours • Free

The Nappiology Expo is an intoxicating napptural (natural and nappy) experience for both men, women and children. We are inviting vendors to provide information and services about natural hair products and styles.
Nappiology is the study of napptural (nappy and natural) hair. We educate, embrace and celebrate our natural beauty and nappy roots.

We’re an active social networking hair group bonded together by our love of natural beauty and nappy roots.
The Nappiology community is composed of those visiting the site to learn, share, and make informed purchases and decisions across multiple categories and material. In the hair care category alone, a signficant percentage of our nappiology members buya large numberof natural hair care products per month. One out of three nappiology members spend more than $300 per year on natural hair products.
Nappiology, Inc hosted its third (3rd) natural hair show for those who lived in the DFW and surrounding areas on November 2011. We had over 2000 people to attend last year.  On June 16, 3012, Nappiology hosted the Fro Fest for the City of Desoto with special guests, Miko and Titi Branch, founders of Miss Jessies&#39;s celebratuing our natural roots Juneteenth.  Fro Fest had over 2500 people in attendance.

The choice to go natural has grown tremendously. Women, men and children everywhere are choosing healthy natural hair over tradition. Studies show that a significant percentage of African Americans are now wearing their hair chemical-free and that number is rapidly increasing.  Natural hair is becoming the main stream in our society especially in the advertisement industry. For example: We are seeing more natural hair models being exposed in tv commercial advertisements.

Masuma Rasheed, Ph.D. is an experienced licensed professional counselor in addition to a LifeForce Yoga® Practitioner. It is said that the highest spiritual practice is self observation without judgment. In fact, compassionate self-awareness is a pillar of yogic practice, just as it is in counseling.

The goal of this workshop is to combine the use of your mind and body in order to learn skills on how to manage:

Stress
Poor Concentration
Exhaustion
Anxiety
Feeling Overwhelmed/Pressure
Frustration

In this workshop, you will learn the following:
 

Learn specific breath work, simple body movement, and meditation techniques intentionally designed to work with elevating the mood. (NO YOGA MAT required; no alignment postures will be performed).
Learn specific breathing and cleansing exercises to reduce lethargy and anxiety.
Learn therapeutic counseling + yoga techniques to increase your insight, self-acceptance, self-esteem, and ability to cope; specifically catered towards women.

 
LifeForce Yoga® practice is body awareness and is supported by evidence based research in psycho-neurobiology to assist in reducing tension and heightening self-acceptance. These specific techniques offer a compassionate approach to relieving distress.
 
My Fit Foods will provide lunch and a nutritionist to answer questions on nutrition and healthy living.
 
This workshop provides a fun experience where you will learn more about yourself, experience cohesion with other women in the community, and learn techniques to handle daily stressors.

The NoSQL movement is an attractive alternative to the relational approach when distribution, scalability and model flexibility are most important. The seemingly absent restrictions on the data minimize the cost of development and system downtime usually associated with schema-based solutions. However, this flexibility often makes interacting with these database very coupled to a particular vendor or api. In this presentation, we will select the document database MongoDB and show how we can leverage existing tools and apis to abstract away any Mongo details and present a consistent and unified programming experience for accessing your data.

 Moving and transforming data can be a difficult job.  Connecting to various endpoints, applying complex transformations, performing validation checks, creating an appropriate audit trail, and other tasks can make the ETL developer feel like he/she is spinning plates.  Even with powerful tools such SQL Server Integration Services, designing and maintaining a proper and well-performing extraction/transformation/loading (ETL) infrastructure is a significant undertaking.
In this full-day preconference seminar, we&#39;ll explore some common (and a few uncommon) challenges facing ETL developers, followed by practical solutions and recommended practices from the field using SQL Server Integration Services.  Presented by business intelligence consultant and SQL Server MVP Tim Mitchell, this preconference seminar brings together his 9 years of professional data management experience into 7+ hours of condensed real-world approaches to ETL challenges.  Though we&#39;ll spend some time covering the academic portion of the concepts presented, most of our time will be spent in demos to give you more than just a theoretical exploration of these methods.

Remember, you can’t learn Spanish in just three days.  But you will learn to pick up on key words/danger words that will assist you to get the help that is needed for the emergency.Join us on August 18 as Dr. Spurlock who specializes in Fibromyalgia, Lyme, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Sleep Therapy, Chronic Viral Syndromes and Body Detoxification teaches us how to heal our bodies.

Are there any pre-requisites for attending?

What are your Terms and Conditions?
Our training terms and conditions can be read here and you will be asked to accept these terms and conditions in order to secure your booking.
Can these courses be run on-site at my company?
Yes, private on-site training courses represent better value with an audience of three or more students and allow the instructor to focus on the client’s specific website, environment and challenges. We run private, on-site Google Analytics workshops virtually every week.
Courses work best in a quiet training room, where students should be individually equipped with Internet-connected PCs. In the absence of an on-site training room, a board room or meeting room works well with attendees bringing their own laptops with them or using previously set-up desktop PCs.

ObjectiveThis course is designed to teach you the Revit functionality as you would work with it in the design process. Begin by learning about the user interface and the Revit commands for design development, followed by those available for construction documentation. 
Who Should AttendNew users of Autodesk Revit.
DescriptionRevit Architecture is a powerful Building Information Modeling (BIM) program that works the way Architects design. From Preliminary Design through Design Development, and into Construction Documents, the program streamlines the design process with a central 3D model. Changes made in one view update across all views and on the printable sheets.
Since building projects themselves tend to be extremely complex, Revit Architecture is a necessarily a complex program. The objective of the Revit Architecture 2012 Fundamentals course is to enable students to create full 3D architectural project models and set them up in working drawings. This training guide focuses on basic tools that the majority of users need to work with Revit Architecture 
Topics include:

Understand the purpose of Building Information Management (BIM) and how it is applied in Revit
Using the Revit Architecture workspace and interface
Working with the basic drawing and editing tools in Revit
Creating Levels and Grids as datum elements for the model
Creating a 3D building model with walls, curtain walls, windows, and doors
Adding floors and roofs to the building model
Creating standard and custom stairs
Detailing Reflected Ceiling Plans with ceilings and lighting fixtures
Adding component features, such as furniture and equipment
Setting up sheets for plotting with text, dimensions, details, tags, and schedules 
Creating details  

Prerequisitesan understanding of Architectural terminology is an asset.
Class OutlineThe topics covered will vary slightly with each class based upon the pace of the students. As an Autodesk Authorized Training Center, we adhere to the strict quality control procedures established by Autodesk to consistently deliver the highest caliber learning experience possible.

THE ROAD ADVENTURE PART 3

If you imagine yourself as a pumpkin when you first came into this Road Adventure experience, in Part 1, they sort of &#34;cut you open&#34; and began the process of scooping out a lot of &#34;gunk&#34; in your life. In Part 2, they continued that process and then carved a smile on your face. In Part 3, we put the light inside, by helping you to find hope and a purpose so that you can be a blessing to others.
Friday night of Part 3 deals with the past. Saturday morning continues the process of healing past hurts. Saturday afternoon transitions into exercises that help you to better handle the present by learning to set Boundaries and have better relationships. Sunday is all about the future. We show you what you already have inside of you - that special gift that enables you to walk into your destiny with hope and a purpose.

The biggest piece of missing training in databases is enterprise training.  DBAs are often taught syntax and usage of features, but they’re never taught how to actually use them to plan an enterprise, run an enterprise, or cope with changing requirements, manage difficult users or groups, manage growth, manage vendors, etc.  There are so many more requirements to running an enterprise than just knowing how the individual features work.  There are disk and backup requirements, auditing requests, end-user reporting, paranoid VPs, and much more.  And there’s no way to gain this type of business sense on your own.  You have to learn from seasoned pros who have been there many times over.
I’ve built many successful DBA teams in a few companies that were resistant to the change.  And I can show you how to do it too.  Take your daily tasks down to almost nothing while you increase your visibility in your company (in a positive way).
What you will learn:
1.       How to properly manage a large environment.
2.       Managing disk space and growth requirements across hundreds of servers.
3.       Manage end user expectations.
4.       Build a self-service reporting model to keep DBAs from having to field every day requests.
5.       Reduce security management issues by up to 90%.
6.       How to assess your biggest DBA resource hogs to make the most impact in your environment.
7.       Strategies for dealing with vendors and vendor security issues.
8.       How to hire a competent DBA.
9.       How to staff your company appropriately.  Do you know how many DBAs you need?
10.   How to get a bigger raise and make your company pay for training.
And much much more.  If you manage an enterprise or would like to then you can’t afford to miss this seminar.  No other training exists to take you from being a regular DBA to running and leading an enterprise database effort.  And don’t fool yourself;  There is a real difference.  Get ready to take your skills and your career to the next level.

Saturday, November 3, 10AM-1PM (The Art of Metaphor); 2-5PM (On Process and Progress)
10809 Garland Road, Dallas 75218

The Art of Metaphor: Melville’s white whale and Walker’s color purple. Frost’s mending wall and Cervantes’ windmills. Woolf’s lighthouse and Carver’s cathedral. Basho’s pond and Bishop’s fish and Naipaul’s river bend. We all recognize the precision and poignancy of these metaphors. Those crystalline choices their creators made to deeply and simultaneously etch into our minds both image and meaning. As writers, how can we bring that kind of consciousness into the ongoing process of our own work? How can we make a single image signify and resonate throughout our varied prose &amp;/or poems? How can we start recognizing potential metaphors in both our working drafts and our everyday lives? Through readings and exercises, this workshop offers a vibrant study and practice of this often overlooked yet highly resonant element of our craft. Open and useful to writers of all genres. On Process and Progress: Do you have trouble getting yourself to the writing desk? Or once there, find yourself unfocused, thwarted, or unable to achieve a consistency of output? These are common occurrences for writers, and we often mistakenly think the difficulty lies within the product of our writing rather than its process. This workshop will help draw your attention not to what is on the page, but how it got there. And, more specifically, why sometimes it gets there with relative ease, and other times not. Through a progression of writing exercises, investigations, and open discussions, this workshop offers a highly interactive opportunity to make a clear and in-depth assessment of one’s individual writing environment, practices, and regime. Such objective study and shared dialogues often yield unforeseen insights that can in turn affect one’s productivity and advancement dramatically. Expect to acquire practical tools, approaches, and tricks of the trade to bring home and apply to your ongoing process.
MARC NIESON&#39;s writing has appeared in the Iowa Review, Chautauqua, Conjunctions, and Hawk &amp; Handsaw. His prose has earned two Pushcart Prize nominations and a Raymond Carver Short Story Award. His award-winning feature-length screenplays include Speed of Life, The Dream Catcher, and Bottomland. He serves on the faculty of Chatham University, and is working on a new novel, Houdini’s Heirs.

Presented by
Jim Matthews, CPA
There is a lot to understand when it comes to investing in real estate. Not the least of which is how to find a great deal, how to fund the deal and then how to get out of it when the time comes. 
But did you know, there are numerous tax codes that deal with the various real estate activities and depending how you participate in them, will determine the amount of taxes you pay? 
A CPA that is good for investors will understand the nature of the real estate industry and have a good understanding of tax and business issues. Just as all investors are not created equal, all CPAs are not created equal. 
That is why we are very excited to host for the first time, one of the preeminent Certified Public Accounts in the area, Jim Matthews, as he presents: Real Estate Investing and the IRS: Why Pay More Taxes Than You Have To...

Sweet Baby Dreams Cooperative Presents
 
Mommy &amp; Me Infant Massage Class
 
Infant massage is an important and often forgotten way to connect with your baby. It can be especially beneficial to babies with cholic, torticollis or overall tight muscles. It is the best way for you and your baby to connect and learn about each other. The effects are everlasting.
 
 As Infant massage teaches parents the art of healthy, communicative touch. Massaging infants helps them to sleep and eat better; it reduces colic pain and strengthens the parent-child bond.
 
 
 
Come and learn why babies who are massaged are more alert, responsive and better able to calm and console themselves more easily.  
 
Mommy &amp; Me Infant Massage is taught by Jennifer Todd-Barnard, a Dallas Occupational Therapist with over 15 years of experience.  Jennifer is founder of Baby Begin, a company whose mission is to provide families with the most up-to-date information about prevention of plagiocephaly, torticollis and treatment of neck tightness. 
For questions, please email Jennifer@babybegin.net.
 
 
 
 The single most important thing you can teach your dog is to come reliably in all situations &amp; environments.  Here are several reasons a reliable recall will benefit you &amp; your dog:

When it&#39;s time to come in from outside.
When you are at a safe, dog-frienly park.
When someone leaves the door open or he slips out.
If your dog is reactive or aggressive a solid recall can save someone!
If you go hiking with your dog.
If you are working towards a reliable off-leash dog, start with a solid recall.
If your dog is facing danger &amp; you need him to come back.

The list goes on &amp; on.  If you would like to participate in our Rockin&#39; Recall Series here are the steps: 1) Visit our Facebook page &amp; follow the series there. (If you are not on Facebook then email Stacy &amp; she can send you the goodies!) 2) Find the post on Facebook that says, &#34; I&#39;M A ROCKIN&#39; RECALL PARTICIPANT&#34; &amp; click &#34;Comment&#34;.  Add your name &amp; your dog&#39;s name &amp; breed in the comment. (Example: Jane Smith/Rocky/Labrador Retriever) 3) Check back daily (on Facebook) for instructions on that day&#39;s series info.  Read all articles &amp; watch all videos with &#34;Rockin&#39; Recall&#34; in the post title. 4) Join the &#34;Rockin&#39; Recall Workshop&#34; on Saturday, August 4th at 10am via this Eventbrite Event! 5) Come to the &#34;Rockin&#39; Recall Workshop&#34; in August at the park &amp; practice, tweak, &amp; perfect all your work up to that point!

These are the Facts:
 ·        The Dallas Crime Index indicates that we are in the fourth percentile for safety. In other words, 96% of American cities are safer than our city. In Dallas, 223 crimes are committed per square mile; the national average is 39.
·         According to research done by the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network, only 46 out of every 100 rapes in the U.S. are reported to police.  Of those 100 rapes, only 12 lead to an arrest; of those 12 arrests, only 9 are prosecuted; of those 9 prosecuted, only 5 lead to a felony conviction; of those 5 felony convictions, only 3 rapists spend at least one day in prison.
·         According to the Department of Justice, “homicide” is the leading cause of death of women in the workplace.
·         Every 9 seconds in the US a woman is assaulted or beaten.
·         Ninety-two percent of women surveyed listed reducing domestic violence and sexual assault as their top concern.
 ·         Every day in the US, more than three women are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends.
 
What Every Woman Should Know
 
This is a seminar for adult, professional women.  The purpose of this seminar is to develop and/or enhance critical thinking skills should you be placed in a compromising if not threatening situation, learning to see these things &#34;before&#34; they happen, and thus hopefully avoid them altogether.  The basic idea is to teach you &#34;how to spot trouble before trouble spots you&#34;!
 
Dinner service begins at 6:15pm (dinner included in your ticket price)  7pm First Hour:  Safety on the Street Who are the three most-targeted women according to rapists and “why”?  What are the two major causal factors contributing to rape?  What are the two biggest deterrents to an attack?  What personalities, behaviors, and “lures” should cause you concern in one-time interactions on the street or out with friends?  What are two key questions that can help you quickly avoid potentially dangerous, yet seemingly innocent situations?  This hour will look at the nature of the instincts, your early-warning-system, how and why it works as well as ways to more fine-tune the process by some basic profiling techniques.
 
Short Intermission between the hours
 
8pm Second Hour: Safety in the Home What are some “best practices” when meeting someone from online?  When dating, what behavior patterns should cause concern?  What is the &#34;Grandmother Test&#34;? When calling for outside contractors to come in your home or apartment what two questions should you ask them first?  When working in your home what questions should such workers never ask you?  This hour will look at the typical behaviors that often betray later abusive relationships, as well as some general guidelines of positive relationship signs.  Also, we will look at service providers in the home and strategies to employ when contracting these and when they are in the home executing their duties; what is appropriate versus inappropriate behavior from those you invite into your home or apartment. And finally, what about the various self-defense devices sold on the market?  Do they really work?  And if they do work -- when, where and why?  
 Each attendee will also receive a copy of Jeff&#39;s book, Power Proverbs for Personal Defense, a handbook reinforcing many of the strategies discussed in this program.

Many of us raised with the myth of proteins, fear becoming weak if we don’t eat some fish, meat or chicken.  But this myth we can start by discrediting it if we imagine an elephant eating leaves and branches.  As a matter of fact, some of the strongest animals of the world are strict vegetarians.  When a person finds out than within him his spiritual nature is awakening, he starts experiencing many changes.  One of them is the development of a sensitivity through which the relationship between his body and his soul takes a new meaning and importance.  The inner vision of the soul reveals aspects to him that he did not know or felt before.  His subtle energies become more tangible and that person clearly finds out if what his body had ingested was really healthy.
 
Why follow a vegetarian diet?

·         According to the Department of Justice, “homicide” is the leading cause of death of women in the workplace.
·         Every 9 seconds in the US a woman is assaulted or beaten.
·         Ninety-two percent of women surveyed listed reducing domestic violence and sexual assault as their top concern.
 ·         Every day in the US, more than three women are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends.
 
What Every Woman Should Know
 
This is a seminar for adult, professional women.  The purpose of this seminar is to develop and/or enhance critical thinking skills should you be placed in a compromising if not threatening situation, learning to see these things &#34;before&#34; they happen, and thus hopefully avoid them altogether.  The basic idea is to teach you &#34;how to spot trouble before trouble spots you&#34;!
 
Lunch service begins at 12:15pm (lunch included in your ticket price)  First Hour:  Safety on the Street Who are the three most-targeted women according to rapists and “why”?  What are the two major causal factors contributing to rape?  What are the two biggest deterrents to an attack?  What personalities, behaviors, and “lures” should cause you concern in one-time interactions on the street or out with friends?  What are two key questions that can help you quickly avoid potentially dangerous, yet seemingly innocent situations?  This hour will look at the nature of the instincts, your early-warning-system, how and why it works as well as ways to more fine-tune the process by some basic profiling techniques.
 
Short Intermission between the hours
 
Second Hour: Safety in the Home What are some “best practices” when meeting someone from online?  When dating, what behavior patterns should cause concern?  What is the &#34;Grandmother Test&#34;? When calling for outside contractors to come in your home or apartment what two questions should you ask them first?  When working in your home what questions should such workers never ask you?  This hour will look at the typical behaviors that often betray later abusive relationships, as well as some general guidelines of positive relationship signs.  Also, we will look at service providers in the home and strategies to employ when contracting these and when they are in the home executing their duties; what is appropriate versus inappropriate behavior from those you invite into your home or apartment. And finally, what about the various self-defense devices sold on the market?  Do they really work?  And if they do work -- when, where and why?  
 Each attendee will also receive a copy of Jeff&#39;s book, Power Proverbs for Personal Defense, a handbook reinforcing many of the strategies discussed in this program.

  Being stressed is uncomfortable. When you know why stress happens, you will know how to deal with it and how to antidote it. The trick is to learn the essential tools that stop stress happening. 
 
Regardless of its origins, stress drains our physical, emotional and mental energy. 
Several myths exist about the causes of stress and the most effective ways of dealing with it.  
Stress is short for distress, the feeling where we are unhappy, fearful, emotionally vulnerable or just plain angry. What we forget is that stress is a valuable signpost telling us we have a problem somewhere and that it needs attention. When stressed, your well-being becomes unwell being!
The trick is to see the messenger for what it is, read the message and take action:

acknowledge there is a problem: remember the symptoms of stress are giving you an opportunity to deal with it!;
accept the emotional and/or physical symptoms are there because you are struggling;
understand the problem gives you a positive lesson about you and how to manage your life;
act to improve your life situation – change your attitude or approach, change your circumstances or just take some space;
enjoy how pleased you are for caring for your self, just when you needed it!


 A Managing Stress seminar can free you from these illusions and misconceptions and give you a new perspective. You will learn how to: 

Identify different levels of stress and rise above them to create a relaxed mind and body.
Protect yourself from negative influences.
Gain confidence in dealing with difficult relationships.

Presenter Bio
Cheryl Rayl is a licensed Professional Counselor with over 25 years of experience working with people who hear voices. She helped facilitate the first Schizophrenia Anonymous groups launched by NAMI in Jacksonville, FL in the late nineties. Although Cheryl has always had an academic interest and a heart for people experiencing hearing voices, her interest became personal and her heart became passionate in 2003 when her son joined the ranks of those dealing with this issue. The combination of her professional years of working with people affected by this issue and her personal struggles in dealing with someone she loves make her a dynamic and genuine facilitator of this fascinating and highly impactful workshop. Anyone who has clients (or loved ones) struggling with hearing voices should attend.
Rayl Enterprises is an approved provider for the following continuing education credit:
Licensed Professional Counselors, Provider #1688
Licensed Clinical Social Workers, Provider #6191

What’s the format of the training?
The seminars are hands-on courses where attendees use their own Google Analytics account and their own data, completing exercises under the direction of an experienced instructor. In our opinion, this format is the most effective for adult learning and knowledge retention. Our seminar leader presents material using PowerPoint, engaging students with relevant theory, practical examples and exercises to reinforce key concepts.
Who are the instructors?
Most of our Google Analytics workshops are delivered by Matt Trimmer, Principal Consultant and Managing Director of ivantage, who brings his practical consulting experience and passion for the Internet into the classroom to vitalize the sessions. Read Matt’s biography on our team page. Matt is a Google Analytics Seminar Leader.
Most of the Google AdWords workshops are led by Sharron Lonsdale who, by virtue of also being a Google Analytics Seminar Leader, is able to give Matt an occasional break as a Google Analytics instructor. Sharron is a Senior Consultant at ivantage and possesses a thoroughness and attention to detail which ensures that students do not leave a course without having got the most from it.

How do I book?
Please select a suitable date to attend from our list of courses and enter the number of tickets you require, and then select ‘Order Now’. All our public training courses can then be paid for by credit card using Google Checkout, or payment by invoice may be requested.
Are there any pre-requisites for attending?
Students will require online Administration access to an active (recording some data) Google Analytics and/or Google AdWords (depending on the days attended) account throughout the courses. For AdWords, you can attend the advanced course only if you have previously attended the introduction course.
What are your Terms and Conditions?
Our training terms and conditions can be read here and you will be asked to accept these terms and conditions in order to secure your booking.
Can these courses be run on-site at my company?
Yes, private on-site training courses represent better value with an audience of three or more students and allow the instructor to focus on the client’s specific website, environment and challenges. We run private, on-site Google Analytics workshops virtually every week.
Courses work best in a quiet training room, where students should be individually equipped with Internet-connected PCs. In the absence of an on-site training room, a board room or meeting room works well with attendees bringing their own laptops with them or using previously set-up desktop PCs.
Feel free to contact us now to discuss your requirements.

As you may know if you have worked with SEO professionals in the past, the implementation and execution of SEO is not nearly as simple as that. The SEO course in Inuvate U’s Management Series will deliver clear explanations of the basic mechanics of SEO with a focus on managing an internal or external SEO team for more effective campaigns.

GRC Fundamentals Seminar 
 
In today’s complex global business environment and legal landscape, having a transparent view of information and a coordinated approach to the governance and management of performance, risk and compliance is critical to success. Organizations that understand and apply the principles of integrated governance, risk and compliance (GRC),in both processes and technology, have a real competitive advantage.  They improve their ability to make well informed strategic decisions and are better able to response with agility and speed to threats (legal and ethical breeches) and opportunities (customer satisfaction and trust) that arise.  
 
The objective of this seminar is to provide attendees (in-house counsel, compliance and ethics professionals, internal auditors, CSR professionals, strategy professionals) with the knowledge necessary to efficiently design and enhance GRC activities across the business based on established GRC standards. Through lectures and practical group interaction, discussions, and exercises, attendees learn about defining a GRC strategy, building and enhancing corporate ethics and compliance programs, strengthening core business processes, and improving use of technology to support the integrated governance,management and assurance of performance, risk and compliance.  
 
At the heart of the seminar is the OCEG GRC Capability Model. Although various standards and frameworks exist to address discrete portions of governance, risk management and compliance issues, the OCEG GRC Capability Model is the only open standard that provides comprehensive and detailed practices for an integrated GRC program.
 
Organizations can use the GRC Capability Model to address a broad GRC program across the organization or develop a structure within domains of GRC (e.g., legal, compliance, risk management, audit).  The goal is to make GRC processes more effective, efficient, and agile to the needs of the business.

Objective
Taught from a real-world perspective, this course follows the design process and provides exercises that reflect realistic examples. This course teaches MEP engineers how Revit MEP works, why the tools work the way they do, and how they can help the engineer in daily work. 
Who Should AttendNew users of Autodesk Revit MEP.
Description

In this course, the engineer and designer are introduced to the fundamental items they need to understand Revit MEP. Beginning with the rules, the interface and explanations of design and process workflow, the course moves into where the project begins - with exercises on setting up a project in the most efficient fashion possible. A section on how to analyze the building model follows the project setup. Breaking the project up into workable pieces known as worksets completes the first section of the training.
Subsequent chapters include explanations and exercises for creating HVAC, electrical, plumbing, process piping and fire protection systems within the project. After reviewing these items, the user is moved back into the common portions of the program, including running interference detection tools, coordination with other disciplines, annotating views and completing schedules.

PrerequisitesAn understanding of building systems (HVAC, Electrical and Plumbing systems)terminology is an asset.

3 weeks: Tuesdays, October 2, 16 &amp; 23, 7-9PM
10809 Garland Road, Dallas 75218

In this course, we will examine two of Shakespeare’s most famous tragedies—Hamlet and Othello. Specifically, we will look at the differences in the treatment of the self and of the conventions of tragedy in each play. We will delve into the interiority of Hamlet’s mind and reflect on how this interiority contributes to the tragedy. We will look at the way that Iago manipulates Othello, and consider how the play, Othello, approaches tragedy differently than Hamlet. In the first week of this three-week course, students will be provided with an overview of Shakespearean tragedy, with an emphasis on Hamlet and Othello. We will cover Hamlet and Othello in the second and third weeks, respectively. Students should come prepared not only to listen and discuss, but also possibly to perform (or read aloud) short segments of each play.
HEIDI CEPHUS graduated from Southwestern University in 2003 with a BA in psychology and from the University of Texas at Arlington in 2006 with an MA in English literature. She has worked as a technical writer, a freelance writer, and an adjunct instructor. She is currently pursuing a doctorate in English from the University of North Texas, with an emphasis in Early Modern studies. She looks forward to sharing her love of Shakespeare with the Writer’s Garret this fall.

 Optional Reading for the Course 
   Exploring Scrum: The Fundamentals  (People, Product, and Practices) by Dan Rawsthorne and Doug Shimp  . Dan Rawsthorne and Doug Shimp have trained and coached thousands of people, most of them whom are already using Scrum, their most common complaint is that they need help to do it right.  And many (if not most) of them need some help.  
This book is for them and others like them.
This book is not an introductory text. Dan and Doug assume that those who read this book know, or think they know, something about Scrum. This book takes a deep, exploratory, look into the Scrum framework, and offers advice about how to think about it, and how to use it. Some of this advice is philosophical, some is pragmatic, some is practical, and some of it is controversial.

This class is for people who want to learn how to lead a mission trip. It consists of three basic parts.
Part 1:  Means &amp; Ends.   
This section covers the means of doing short-term mission, such as budgeting, how to find a project site, how to recruit a team, and how to organize your trip. However, we also cover the ends. This means we discuss the bigger picture of everyone&#39;s agenda involved, as well as the values and philosophies of ministry that undergird the decisions we are making as team leaders.  
 
Part 2: Team Dynamics
This section will address issues that arise when a group of people who don&#39;t know each other very well travel together to a strange destination to do physically challenging labor on a schedule that someone else chose. What do you do when someone doesn&#39;t want to cooperate?  Are challenging you as a leader?  Constantly complains? Has the wrong attitude? How do you instill the proper attitude and values into the team in order to avoid all this?
 
LUNCH BREAK
 
Part 3: International Teams
This section covers material specific to international teams, such as passports, visas, airfare, communicating with your hosts, and more.

I’m pleased to announce Brinks, Inc. continues to partner with Smith System to provide our driver trainers a high-quality defensive driving curriculum to take with them back to the field. You will receive an in-depth, high-powered message that will challenge your knowledge, observation and training skills and techniques, and enhance your ability to deliver this vital material to your respective students. With an easy-to-understand and common sense approach, this training will ensure you’re well-equipped to make an immediate impact both as a leader and a trainer within the Brinks company.  
 
Our expectation of you is to deliver the material exactly as you will be trained.  We will provide each each of you with the physical materials, forms, handouts, etc. used in your Smith System classroom so you can transition from student to trainer immediately upon your return to the branch!
 
We are offering two courses of instruction—Initial Train-the-Trainer course, and the Trainer Refresher course. 
 
Initial/Train-the-Trainer Course—The first step in your ongoing development as a Driver Trainer. Provides in-depth instruction in a classroom of your peers, builds basic and mid-level training methods, and provides the tools and confidence you’ll need as a Brinks professional trainer.
 
Trainer Recertification Course—The next step in your ongoing development as a professional trainer.  Designed for active and highly-experienced trainers, this course moves quickly—if you hold fewer than 12-15 training sessions a year, then you are likely struggle with the curriculum as this course is not designed for you (Please reattend the Train-the-Trainer course).
 
The Smith System defensive driving trainer curriculum has been streamlined and altered to mirror core Brinks needs. There have been enough material revisions that several of our experienced, but perhaps less-skilled instructors current instructors have struggled during the recertification classes.
 
If you are unsure which course you should attend, please contact your Regional Master Trainer, your Regional Safety Manager, or Alan Brunke at (469) 549-6032.
 
Responsibility…remember, you as a trainer are the backbone or our company’s driver training initiative.  You alone have the ability to get our drivers started on the right path, to build their knowledge base, to provide the tools that will get them through those critical first 3 to 6 months of their Brinks driving experience.

1: Choosing a Path

Whether you are a freelance manicurist, make-up artist or photographer, creating your own brand and career direction is essential. You MUST know where you are going and remain true to that path. At the end of this segment you will develop a personal tool that will serve as a mission statement for your career.

4: Next level thinking
Next level thinking produces next level results! This workshop will address what specific steps you need to take to begin your career or accelerate a seasoned career. In these dire economic times it takes creative thinking to develop an edge over the competition.

YOU WANT MORE SUCCESS WITH WOMEN.

At the ABCs of Attraction, this is our ONE AND ONLY goal for our students.

Exclusive and field tested tactics, routines, and stories that utilize being Asian (or other) to YOUR ADVANTAGE for Interracial Dating &amp; Pick-up SUCCESS!
30 hours worth of training over 3 days and 3 nights
The workshop section has four to five hours of seminars, lectures, &amp; intense interactive drills
FREE Pre-bootcamp Package that includes assignments, missions, and homework specially designed to get you READY and WARMED up BEFORE the bootcamp!
FREE Pre-bootcamp Phone Consultation with an ABCs staff member to go over your homework and prepare you for the big day!

Inner Game (10 Pillars of Strength &amp; Lifestyle)
Outer Game (Subcommunication &amp; Bodylanguage)
Verbal Attraction (Bantering &amp; Storytelling)



Then the fun starts!

Each evening, students head out to local hotspots with our instructors for a night of socializing with the kind of women they have only dreamed of before.
Our 3:1 student – instructor ratio offers each ABCs student as much 1-on-1 help as they can handle. And after each in-field exercise is a debriefing session where students can get feedback on how they did.
Often times, our students meet someone special during the bootcamp, which alone can be well worth the price of attending.

AND HERE IS THE BEST PART:
Head instructor JT the Asian Playboy does not belong to any large corporation, and is not interested in fly-by-night schemes. He is interested in YOUR SUCCESS, and has designed a program that keeps students in REGULAR contact with instructors through meetings and our internet boards.
In other words, THIS IS NOT A ONE- WEEKEND THING.
We have gotten tired of hearing stories where a guys takes a bootcamp at another company, gets some success, and then slowly loses his skills. THIS IS NOT TRUE INSTRUCTION, but a temporary fix.
After YEARS of teaching his own highly successful bootcamps, APB has designed a SPECIALIZED program of hardcore instruction combined with multiple follow up meetings. Our alumni have a chance to meet with their instructors even AFTER they graduate from the bootcamp.
We believe our students are a reflection of our company, and our goal is to assure that all of them are successful. Where other companies cut contact with students when the bootcamp ends, your bootcamp is an induction into a brotherhood of amateur and veteran social artists who truly want to help each other.
And guess what? WE DON’T CHARGE EXTRA FOR THE FOLLOW-UP REUNIONS.
This is not some scheme where we raised the prices of our programs.
APB has chosen to offer FREE follow-up events because he is dedicated to seeing his students grow and become successful with women. Having learned from the best, APB understands that, while a bootcamp can skyrocket your success, follow up is essential to truly develop your social skills.
Here is what some students are saying about our program:

The ABCs of Attraction is one of the rare companies that offers programs like this, which is why we have had such a high student success rate.
We view teaching as more than a method. We see it as aMOVEMENT of men learning how to properly socialize, interact and date women.
Now you can learn the A-F secrets of how to meet beautiful women and begin your own journey of personal improvement.
Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s time?
EMPOWER YOURSELF!

Objective
The objective of the Revit Architecture Advanced course is to enable students who have worked with Revit to expand their knowledge in setting up office standards with templates that include annotation styles, preset views, sheets, and schedules, as well as creating custom element types and families. This course will also cover techniques to increase productivity while working with other people on a team, either in the same firm or with other firms, and while working with Revit files or other CAD files.
As architects and designers start a project, they frequently think about the overall massing of a building or the area of the footprint. This course covers tools for creating mass elements that can be modified into many shapes. Students then apply walls, roofs, and floors applied to the mass elements. This course also covers space planning tools for setting up areas for rooms and also applying colors to them to show the connections. For presentations and analysis, this course teaches you how to create and render perspective views and create walkthroughs and solar studies
Revit Architecture’s main purpose is to design buildings – walls, doors, floors, roofs, and stairs. However, architects also frequently need to add site and structural information. This course covers the elements and tools in Revit Architecture that are used to create topographic surfaces for site work and to add structural elements.
Who Should AttendExperienced users of Autodesk Revit Architecture wanting to leverage the power of Autodesk&#39;s BIM solution.
Description
Building Information Modeling (BIM) is an approach to the entire building life cycle. Revit Architecture is a powerful BIM program that supports the ability to coordinate, update, and share design data with team members throughout the design, construction, and management phases of a building’s life. A key component in managing the BIM process is to establish a company foundation for different types of projects by creating standard templates and custom elements. Having this in place makes the process of any new project flow smoothly and efficiently.
Topics include:

Create schedules, including material takeoff schedules with formulas
Create custom wall, roof, and floor types
Set up a family file
Create family geometry
Create family types
Create standard and custom stairs
Create specific families, including custom doors and windows, in-place families, profiles, railings, and shared parameters
Set up project phasing
Create and display a variety of design options
Use groups
Link Revit files
Import and export files, including exporting for energy analysis
Understand, use, and set up worksets
Use multi-discipline coordination
Creating In-Place Conceptual Mass elements and Conceptual Mass families
Creating building elements from massing studies
Using Rooms and Areas for space planning and analysis
Creating perspectives, walkthroughs, and solar studies
Understanding the concepts of rendering and lighting
Create topographic surfaces
Add property lines and building pads
Modify toposurfaces with subregions, splitting surfaces and grading the regions
Annotate site plans and add site components
Work with Shared Coordinates
Create structural grids and add columns
Add foundation walls and footings
Add beams and beam systems
Create framing elevations and add braces
Copy and monitor elements across disciplines
Check Interferences

Prerequisites
Students should be comfortable with the fundamentals of Revit as taught in the Revit Architecture 2012 Fundamentals course. Knowledge of basic techniques is assumed, such as creating walls, roofs, and other objects, copying and moving objects, and creating and working with views, etc.
