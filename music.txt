 Since his move to the United States in 1994, Colombian jazz harpist Edmar Castaneda has quite literally taken New York and the world stage by storm with the sheer force of his virtuosic command of the harp–revolutionizing the way audiences and critics alike consider an instrument commonly relegated to the “unusual category.” A master at realizing beautiful complexities of time, while skillfully drawing out lush colors and dynamic spirit, Edmar has been characterized as “almost a world unto himself” (The New York Times). Join us for a great concert!

What is it about these lads that transcends time, crosses generations, and ignites so much universal Love? History simply does not have an art form that parallels this phenomenon.

Please join us for a private loft concert with one of DC&#39;s biggest names, and one of its rising stars. 
On Friday 8/3, Vince Scheuerman (Army of Me, River James) and Marian McLaughlin will play a private loft concert for a small crowd. We&#39;re capping the event at 50 people to keep it intimate, so reserve your spot now by making the suggested donation of $10 above, or going to www.awesomeloftconcert.eventbrite.com if you&#39;re reading this on Facebook or some place else. Can&#39;t wait for the concert!
Note: This event is NOT BYOB. We&#39;ll have a cheap cash bar by suggested donation. It makes it easier for everyone involved and offers another (modest) source of $$ for the artists and the space.
Listen to Vince&#39;s music and check out this interview.
Listen to Marian&#39;s music and read her Pink Line interview.

All about Vince:
Somewhere along the line, Washington DC native Vince Scheuerman fell in love with music. Maybe it was the musical family he grew up in, or maybe the outlet he needed after some rocky early years growing up in a religious cult in Gaithersburg, MD. Either way, he set about to make the dream of a career in music a reality. While still finishing his Mechanical Engineering degree, he started a band which came to be known as Army Of Me. After several years of touring the East Coast, Scheuerman&#39;s Army Of Me inked a record deal with Atlantic Records in 2006. The following year saw the release of the debut full-length album &#34;Citizen&#34;. The record received significant radio and MTV airtime, and was supported with several big tours, including dates with Dave Matthew&#39;s Band, OAR, Switchfoot, The Used, Blue October, and Good Charlotte. In 2009, Scheuerman pared down Army Of Me&#39;s sound with a largely acoustic EP &#34;Make Yourself Naked&#34;. Changing gears, 2010 brought the birth of a new musical project called River James, which Scheuerman again fronted and provided the song material. 2 singles and an EP were well received to both Scheuerman&#39;s fans, and drummer Jacob Marshall&#39;s prior band - Mae&#39;s fans. Scheuerman has been on tour for most of 2012, and recently relocated to the warmer (but not necessarily country) tones of Nashville to plug into the music community there. A forthcoming album will be arriving tentatively in the fall. As Scheuerman will say, the dreams we follow can get battered, bruised, shaken, or even avoided from time to time. But as he also says in the song &#34;Dreams&#34; - &#34;I pray we not forget our dreams&#34;. The music is hopeful, and while always honest, pushes toward the uplifting and redemptive. As he continues to write music and tour, he invites the listeners to join in that journey and to join along in taking the risk to follow their dreams as well. Keep going...
A few words from Marian:
I make what my friends call Fractal Folk - based on the fact that my lyrics bounce around the English language with internal rhyming. I play off of multiple permutations of words and follow similar patterns that later recur at smaller scales, as a fractal would.In my songs, I take delight telling stories, as well as making my own myths and elaborating upon others. My songs explore existence, alliteration, assonace, and dissonance, with themes from Pluto loosing planethood to the Greek story of the abduction of Persephone, as well as homage to a variety of creatures, the color spectrum, and cardinal directions. Weaving together intricate chords in alternate tunings on my nylon-stringed guitar, I’m highly inspired by the fingerpicking of my namesake, John Fahey, but stylistically, I follow in the steps of long-gone songstresses like Dory Previn and Linda Perhacs, and appreciates the innovation of my contemporaries such as Larkin Grimm, Joanna Newsom and St. Vincent. Recently, I opened up for inspirational musicians like Six Organs of Admittance, Cate Le Bon, Matt Valentine, and Marissa Nadler.  2012 Lifestyle Empowerment Symposium

DIEGO&#39;S UMBRELLA:
San Francisco’s ambassadors of gypsy rock, Diego’s Umbrella captures California’s cultural multiplicity with enthusiasm, humor and decadence. Urban, gringo mariachis, possessing a pop sensibility and punk rock energy with  sounds reminiscent of Gogol Bordello, Devotchka and Muse.


&#34;Both Diego’s albums, Viva La Juerga and Double Panther, are exciting twists on popular gypsy fusion, encompassing DeVotchKa’s dramatic sound and Gogol Bordello‘s intensity.&#34; -Crawdaddy Magazine
 “With guitars straight out of a Tarantino movie, the group seamlessly blends mariachi, gypsy, flamenco and ska into one beer-soaked fiesta, with song topics varying from heartache to revolution.” -NewsReview.com
--
SPIRIT ANIMAL: 
Spirit Animal sounds like 90&#39;s Red Hot Chili Peppers meeting LCD Soundsystem when, suddenly, both are karate chopped in the neck by Faith No More.
The band&#39;s most recent release, a 7-inch for “I’m Around&#34; out on Mecca Lecca Records, debuted on AOL&#39;s Spinner.com, has received radio play on shows ranging from KROQ&#39;s &#34;Jonesy&#39;s Jukebox&#34; to WBRU&#39;s &#34;Exposure&#34; in Providence and WCHZ&#39;s &#34;The Radar&#34; in Augusta, and was accompanied by a month-long residency at NYC&#39;s Pianos. The video landed on popular blogs like You Aint No Picasso and the soulful burner was used in an HBO &#34;How to Make It In America&#34; promo.In 2010, Spirit Animal released their debut LP, &#34;The Cost of Living,&#34; a unique and powerful blend of rock, psychedelia and dance. The album garnered similarly broad radio play and earned the band placements on shows like ABC&#39;s &#34;Happy Endings.&#34;On stage, Spirit Animal is at once manic and precise with a non-stop show full of big solos, wild sing-along moments and sweat. The group’s presence has landed them on the bill with Free Energy, Wallpaper, Dam-Funk, Wale, The Heavy and Fitz and the Tantrums.

ALEX CLARE (SF DEBUT)
THE ROYAL CONCEPT (SWEDEN)
 
DJs: AARON AXELSEN AND OMAR
 
ALEX CLARE
You can learn a lot about someone by asking them what they think the greatest record ever made is. Take Alex Clare. Tell him you’re going round to his flat tonight with the express intention of smashing every piece of recorded music he owns – leaving him only one – and the ideas just come tumbling out.
“Wow!” he laughs. “If it was production wise I’d probably go for Radiohead’s OK Computer. It’s an incredible record – kind of mind-blowing really. But it’s not the greatest record ever made…”
Alex stirs his coffee and thinks.
“The first record I ever fell in love with was The Score by The Fugees, but that’s not the greatest record ever made either. I used to think it was The White Album – but it’s not that… I suppose it might be Donny Hathaway’s second album, the one with Magnificent Sanctuary Band on? But I think, really, it’s Stevie Wonder’s Songs In The Key Of Life. That track Have A Talk With God has the most incredible synth parts you’ve ever heard. That’s the greatest record ever made for me.”
He sits back – pleasurably exhausted.
“You can’t touch Stevie,” he says. “Even his bad ones are amazing!”
Alex Clare is just the sort of musician you’re glad is still being made in the country’s basements, backrooms and bedrooms. Born and bred in South East London and raised on his dad’s bebop records, as a child Alex toyed with the trumpet before taking up the drums to help him get rid of all his nervous energy.

WHO
Featuring The Cab, Mayday Parade and Hellogoodbye—three of the world’s most well-known, high-energy bands.
The Cab is an alternative rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada. They have released two successful albums—Whisper War in 2008 and Symphony Soldier in 2011. The Cab’s hit single La La is currently on heavy rotation on SiriusXM’s Hits 1.

In the fall of 2011, the band headlined The Noise Tour powered by Journey’s, a nationwide tour that began in New York.
Hellogoodbye is a power pop band that formed in Huntington Beach, California in 2001. They released their first album Zombies! Aliens! Vampires! Dinosaurs! in 2006 and their follow-up album, Would It Kill You? in 2010. Hellogoodbye are well-known for their DIY ethic, shrill outfits and having a particularly close relationship with their fans.
WHY
GUSH 2012, with the aid of these renowned bands, will usher in the launch of Gushcloud’s digital media platform (http://www.gushcloud.com) in the United States. Gushcloud is social discovery platform for content worth gushing about. Our users—over 70,000 across the globe—are recognized for sharing stories worth gushing about across various social networks. Our twist is that brands can reward users for participating in marketing campaigns posted alongside quality content on the platform.

In under a year, Gushcloud’s people network reaches over 55 million people and continues to grow at a rapid rate.

FAQs
Are there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event?
GAMeBoi SF is an 18+ event. Please bring a valid government ID. Over 70% of the crowd is over 21+ with a median age of 24. Teehee. Stats. 
What are my parking options getting to the event?
There&#39;s lots of &#34;free&#34; parking nearby in the costco parking garage, entrance on 11th Street. Technically, it says you have to pay the numbered spots. But if you go to the 2nd floor closer towards 11th &amp; Harrison, there are no numbered spots. So just a forewarning, we hope no one gets tickets (and we can&#39;t pay them if you do). Just know, our own staff will be parking here ^^;!. Alternatively, we hear the BestBuy parking lot is nearby too! 
Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?
Printed Ticket is one option. However, we encourage you to go paperless! Download the eventbrite app!
What is the refund policy?
All sales are final. ^_^;
Where can I contact the organizer with any questions?

CHROMATICS
Chromatics are the reflection on the dark side of the street. With Night Drive, they were barely there but they seemed to weigh a ton. Beautiful vocals giving life to city phrases, rhythms that keep everyone moving but not quickly enough to miss the crash. There are times when you can’t listen anymore to them because it hurts too much, and then you press play again. There’s an intimate distance to their music, with just enough separation that you don’t really know what’s going on.

 The next Treat Social Club is now officially on the books for July 31st and we are psyched to have the Realistic Orchestra back to anchor the night.  We have lined up a number of collaborators for dance, film and games and we&#39;ve got a new food vendor in store for this one.  As usual, we will debut a few more features for the audience participation games to keep things interesting.   
We are doing the tickets a bit differently this time around by charging $15 upfront so we can better gauge who will be in attendance.
Thanks!

About Slide: Back in the Prohibition Era of San Francisco, 430 Mason Street was a space called the Cable Car Theater. Below the theater was a restaurant called Cafe Dans. In actuality, cafe Dans was not a restaurant, but a speakeasy that could be accessed only by a savvy few that would push a secret wall, leading you to a playground slide. This slide would take you below the street level where one could indulge in illicit gambling and the drinking of bootleg whiskey and spirits. In an era of secret codes and handshakes, the speakeasy was a hidden subculture of nightlife. Old world San Francisco elegance has been reborn. Slide is modern and sophisticated but is also reminiscent of the age of gangsters, flappers and bootleg revelry of years past.Petaluma Music Festival Kick-Off Party

Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde
Bizarre Ride Live is the visually vibrant, aurally astounding, and truly one-of-a-kind tribute to the classic hip-hop album Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde.  Playing The Pharcyde’s seminal debut in its entirety, from start to finish, former members Fatlip and SlimKid3 have re-joined forces with Bizarre Ride producers J-Sw!ft and L.A. Jay to create this unique spectacular. Blurring the lines between a straight up hip-hop show and a theatrical performance, Bizarre Ride Live includes all the original skits and interludes from the record, and even some special surprise guests (“did somebody page Quinton??”). No details are missed out as renowned graffiti artist SLICK, who designed the albums iconic cover, art-directs the stage and live audio-visuals are taken care of by L.A. Jay. Expect animated hip-hop, energetic raps, bright colors, b-boy throw-downs, magnetic visuals, a heavy dose of humour, and absolutely everything in between.  Fatlip: Originally the dancer and lyricist Jammer D, Fatlip became hip-hop’s most treasured under-dog as an MC in The Pharcyde. His 2005 solo album The Loneliest Punk became an underground classic, and he is currently touring the world with his DJ Fatlip brand.  SlimKid3: The ever soulful SlimKid3 always brought a poetic edge to The Pharcyde, and in his blossoming solo career has released two beautiful albums, Liberation and SlimKid3’s Cafe. Now based in Portland he runs the popular hip-hop night Live and Direct PDX.  J-Sw!ft: The musical genius behind Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde’s stunning, jazz-drenched soundscape, J-Sw!ft has produced masterpieces for The Pharcyde and The Wascals, and is to bring out his solo project “The Adventures of Negro Kanevil” this year.  L.A. Jay: Stemming from a musical family background, L.A. Jay produced his first major label record for The Good Girls, All for Your Love, on Motown in 1989. Since, he has produced and remixed many stellar tracks for DV acts such as the Pharcyde and Masta Ace.

BAG RAIDERS (DJ SET)
JEFFREY PARADISE
MILES THE DJ
BT MAGNUM
 
Bag Raider’s long overdue and lovingly anticipated debut self-titled album is finally complete. Now the boys are ready to sit back, kick their feet up and enjoy the sound of jaws collectively dropping across the planet as they deliver one of the most well rounded and unique debut pop albums of the year.Bag Raiders are the combined talents of Jack Glass and Chris Stracey. Together, they produce the sparks of light, aural gems and sonic booms that make up one of the most sought-after up and coming duos on the planet.  After dropping singles on Bang Gang 12s (Fun Punch, Turbo Love) and remixing the likes Cut Copy, Midnight Juggernauts and Kid Sister, the two’s reputation internationally grew, and when they released a little ditty titled ‘Shooting Stars’ they reached every dangerous, dark and smokey corner of the world, making them a household name among in-the-know indie kids, the sweaty dance faithful and the DJs across the globe.A collection of thoughts, ideas and memories, Bag Raiders transcends typical dance and pop boundaries, showcasing the creativity of a band at the forefront of modern production.  The album ticks the right boxes for fans new and old, coming correct with sing-a-long choruses, deep-breath anthems, blissful chill and pure dancefloor energy. In short Bag Raiders debut album adds a new dimension in the cluttered and diluted dance world.

THE VERY BEST
PALNER (URBAN WORLD RECORDS)
SEYE

THE VERY BEST
The Very Best is Malawi&#39;s Esau Mwamwaya and London based producer Johan Hugo (We Don&#39;t Belong in Pacha). By all accounts, the far-flung variables that comprise The Very Best shouldn&#39;t coincide – but then again, how many bands can say they met in an East London (Hackney) junk shop? The chance introduction over the purchase of a bicycle in 2008 led production duo Radioclit to invite Esau Mwamwaya into their studio to collaborate on the mixtape that would launch their career. Containing an infectious cross-pollination of samples and rhythms anchored by Esau&#39;s soaring vocals, the mixtape quickly went viral (with approx. 850,000 downloads to date). Pitchfork offered them a slot at their festival for their U.S. debut, and worldwide tour dates for their infamous live shows followed. 2010 saw the release of the trio&#39;s full length Warm Heart of Africa – featuring Vampire Weekend&#39;s Ezra Koenig and MIA – which led them to share the stage with Florence &amp; the Machine, The xx, Mumford and Sons, and of course Vampire Weekend across Australia, Europe, and Africa. That summer Etienne returned to France (disbanding Radioclit), leaving Johan and Esau in a Swedish cottage laying down tracks that would become the Super Mom mixtape. When it came time for the next album,most of the earlier sessions in NYC were scrapped in favour of what transpired – in true TVB fashion – just last October. Johan flew to Esau&#39;s hometown of Lilongwe, Malawi where they rented a bare bones studio and recorded 9 songs in five weeks. The resulting tracks are their biggest and bravest– and definitely indicative that this project was meant to be, no matter how it came together.

SIMIAN MOBILE DISCO - LIVE
MORE TBA

SIMIAN MOBILE DISCO
It’s not hyperbolic bio speak to say that Simian Mobile Disco are one of the most successful electronic music acts around today. It’s verifiable fact.
Funny thing is, though, the duo of James Ford and James Shaw never planned it that way. Instead, it kind of just happened. The boys started the group on a lark, a side-project from their main group in the mid-’00s, Simian. But as the group imploded on a lengthy tour of the United States, the DJ gigs, remixes and mixes that were once a hobby became a full-time gig.
Things have been hectic ever since. Early singles such as “The Mighty Atom,” “The Count” and Kitsuné hit “Hustler” led to a 2007 debut album Attack Decay Sustain Release on Wichita Recordings. The record was their breakthrough, adding tracks like “It’s the Beat,” “Tits and Acid” and “I Believe” to their discography.
Perhaps more importantly, it also gave birth to what would become one of electronic music’s most talked-about live shows, a celebrated DJing career and respect among their peers for a dedication to an analogue production aesthetic. Their highly improvised live set sees them running circles around a complicated modular rig while their trademark light show pulses along in time, constantly treading the line between crowd-pleasing and cerebral.

PARTICLE
w/
CON BRIO
DJ Señor Oz (Afrolicious)
Particle is an American jam band formed in Los Angeles in 2000. The original members were Dave Simmons (guitar), Steve Molitz (keyboard), Eric Gould (bass), and Darren Pujalet (drums). Simmons died shortly after the formation of the band due to a sudden illness. Guitarist Charlie Hitchcock joined shortly thereafter. Along with The Disco Biscuits and Sound Tribe Sector 9, the group was among the first to blend rock, jazz, funk, and electronica into the milieu of what has been dubbed livetronica (a subgenre of the jam band movement where live bands blend the structures of DJ-produced sequenced electronic music into a more traditional live band setting). Prior to 2006, the band&#39;s repertoire consisted entirely of instrumental material.
The group made a name for itself and built an enthusiastic fan base, known as Particle People, by performing energetic late-night sets at festivals such as Bonnaroo. Reliance on word of mouth from fans, rather than advertising, allowed this group to sell out venues such as the Bowery Ballroom in New York City before they finally released their much anticipated first album, Launchpad, in early 2004. In April and May 2005 the group toured with former Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart as Hydra; the tour received mixed reviews from many Deadheads who were unaccustomed to Particle&#39;s electronic-based approach. Bassist Phil Lesh, also of the Grateful Dead, sat in with the band that summer.

 On Saturday, October 6th Mighty in association with John Davis present the legendary party Body &amp; Soul with François K, Danny Krivit, and Joaquin &#34;Joe&#34; Classell. Getting all three disc jockeys together for this event is not an easy task. Capacity for this event will be strictly limited, so make sure to grab your discount presales for this rare and historic event. All 3 Djs will play from 10pm until LATE taking lucky attendees on a music journey  of deep, soulful house music classics old and new. 
Body &amp; Soul was a weekly dance party in New York City that took place every Sunday afternoon. Years ago founders DJ François K and John Davis proposed the idea for a Sunday afternoon party. &#34;The club owners thought they were crazy,&#34; says Joann Davis, part of the Body &amp; Soul crew &#34;but it caught on. Francois-K and John came up with the name Body and Soul, and it fit. House music has always been about feeling it, sharing the vibe together. The spirituality is in the music. It has nothing to do with organized religion.&#34;

RZA with FULL LIVE BAND

On Thursday, August 16, the leader and architect of the Wu-Tang Clan hip-hop dynasty, the RZA, will take to Mezzanine’s live stage backed by his live band. RZA is a dynamic creative force, a prolific producer and songwriter, composer, MC, author, actor, director and screenwriter. His reach touches numerous creative disciplines blending a Far Eastern martial arts aesthetic with a concrete-bred street based form of New York Hip-Hop. About.com cited him as number three in their list of best hip hop producers of all time. 
Since the Wu-Tang Clan released their debut album &#34;Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&#34; in 1993, RZA has driven the Staten Island (also known as Shaolin) based group and their brand at a frenetic pace developing an industry powerhouse and hip-hop empire. Kris Ex of Rolling Stone called Wu-Tang Clan &#34;the best rap group ever.&#34; A master of aliases, The RZA is also known as the Abbot, or as his alter ego, Bobby Digital, and as a founding member of horrorcore rap group, Tha Gravediggaz, RZA transforms into the RZArector. 
RZA has maintained on iron grip on the production of Wu-Tang albums both as a beatmaker and in a greater sense with ultimate oversight on the direction and aesthetic of each LP. He was as involved in a number of the earlier releases from individual Wu-Tang members, easing his grip in later years. Recently, he has worked with some of the game&#39;s other heavy-hitters including Kanye West, Jay-Z, Nas, Talib Kweli and Busta Rhymes to name a few.
In 2007, RZA wrote the score for the movie &#34;Afro Samurai&#34; starring Samuel L. Jackson. He had a part in the action/adventure movie &#34;Repo Men&#34; starring Jude Law and Forest Whitaker. He has also appeared in a handful of other films including Coffee and Cigarettes, American Gangster, Gospel Hill, Life Is Hot in Cracktown, Ghost Dog and Funny People. This summer RZA has made headlines again with not only news of a tour, but with the announcement that he will be starring and directing a Quentin Tarantino-produced, kung-fu action movie, &#34;Iron Fists&#34; slated for release on Oct. 26, also staring Lucy Lui and Russell Crowe. 
RZA was born in Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York, however, much of his childhood was spent between Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with his father and North Carolina with his uncle. His first stint in Hip-hop started in the late 1980s, when a young RZA and his cousins GZA (then called the Genius) and Ol’ Dirty Bastard (then called Ason Unique, the Specialist, and the Professor) started the rap group, the Force of the Imperial Master which eventually came to be known as the All in Together Now Crew after a single they released by the same name.
Once the group split up, both GZA and RZA sought and landed solo record deals, almost becoming casualties of the music industry. GZA signed with Cold Chillin’ and RZA with Tommy Boy. GZA dropped his LP, Words from the Genius which did not sell well and RZA released the EP, We Love You Rakeem and shortly after found himself in jail, undermining the release. Both artists struggled with creative control during their brief stints at their respective labels and swore they’d master the industry on their own terms. This sequence of events led to the eventual formation of the Wu-Tang Clan with the RZA at the helm.

About Slide: Back in the Prohibition Era of San Francisco, 430 Mason Street was a space called the Cable Car Theater. Below the theater was a restaurant called Cafe Dans. In actuality, cafe Dans was not a restaurant, but a speakeasy that could be accessed only by a savvy few that would push a secret wall, leading you to a playground slide. This slide would take you below the street level where one could indulge in illicit gambling and the drinking of bootleg whiskey and spirits. In an era of secret codes and handshakes, the speakeasy was a hidden subculture of nightlife. Old world San Francisco elegance has been reborn. Slide is modern and sophisticated but is also reminiscent of the age of gangsters, flappers and bootleg revelry of years past.POPSCENE &amp; MEZZANINE PRESENTS

Formed in 2009, the Toronto-based duo released its first singles, “Candy Walls” and “Bulbform,” on Brooklyn-based Sacred Bones Records in 2011 before signing with Arts &amp; Crafts for the 2012 release of their forthcoming debut full length, TRST.
In the last year they’ve performed with DFA1979, Crystal Castles, Austra, Balam Acab, Glass Candy, and Hercules and Love Affair.
Tales of lust, wax, and erotomania carry along on a dense black vapor of speed, space and tears. Trust is a pop hit factory buried deep in the mud.”

 
DZ DEATHRAYS


Without a doubt, Australian two-piece, DZ Deathrays are one of the most hotly talked about bands of the past year. After signing to Melbourne-based record label I OH YOU in early 2011, they’ve been releasing and touring relentlessly, introducing themselves to the world as one of the most brutal new bands on the scene.
After such an exciting year, one is left wondering – what is this band’s story? Where did they come from?

The Flashbulb
Acousmatic, Tape music, IDM , Classical, Glitch

Born in 1978 and raised in the sketchy Ashburn district of South Chicago, Benn Jordan began playing jazz-influenced guitar before reaching the age of attending school. Without any proper musical training, his awkward style of inverted guitar playing and composition knew few restrictions and eventually panned out into full blown albums recorded on tape machines in his bedroom in the mid 1990’s. Being a one man band, Jordan grew quite fond of electronic instruments, which for a period of a few years dominated his compositions as he gained worldwide notoriety as an avant-garde electronic musician using the name “The Flashbulb”.

Bartel
Electronic, Experimental, Ambient

BARTEL was formed in 2008. May of 2009 marked the release of the debut E.P on Alphabasic Records, Chicago. Bartel’s music has been described as “haunting, yet melodic; down-tempo, yet driving. Swelling ambient soundscapes meet with deep glitch cuts, while a dub sensibility keeps it all sounding like a distant memory.” More to the the point, the Bartel aesthetic explores the intersection between ultra- modern synthesis, location recording, and experimental sound design; encouraging an approach to song writing which is both technical and cinematic.

KOAN Sound http://koansound.com/KOAN Sound is an electronic music act consisting of Will Weeks and Jim Bastow, both hailing from Bristol, UK.The group’s early origins and influences lie mainly in acoustic based music, from bands such as Incubus to RATM, but it wasn’t until 2005 that the duo became immersed in electronic music through acts such as Noisia and The Prodigy. Soon after, the growing Dubstep scene in Bristol began to inform their productions, eventually leading to a string of releases on various labels.In early 2011 KOAN Sound released their first extended single, the ‘Max Out EP’. The release signalled a turning point in their production, gradually moving away from the 140bpm template and showcasing a wider range of styles than before. It also helped bring more attention to the act, and led to working with a number of artists, including singer/songwriter Ed Sheeran.Later in the year the group would unveil their biggest release to date, the ‘Funk Blaster EP’ on Skrillex’s OWSLA imprint. The EP achieved the No. 1 spot in the Beatport releases category, and received exclusive featuring from US-based magazine Rolling Stone.The duo rounded off the year with DJ sets across Europe and North America, and picked up ‘Best Breakthrough Artist’ at the Dubstep Music Awards in November. They will be fresh off their Canadian Train tour with the likes of Skrillex, Pretty Lights, Diplo, Grimes &amp; Tokimonsta and ready to slay San Francisco!

KOAN [Pronounced Ko - Anne]: A puzzling, often paradoxical statement or story, used in Zen Buddhism as an aid to meditation and a means of gaining spiritual awakening.

Atom™ + Tobias - LIVE
 (Mule/Logistic :: Chile/Berlin)

Atom™ and Tobias Freund are both well known figures in electronic music. In fact, many would argue that they are living legends. Tobias began his career in the early &#39;80s, mainly using the pseudonym &#34;Pink Elln&#34;. He looks back on a long sequence of music making that has led him from mainstream pop to club music, and then onto the experimental and unclassifiable. Uwe Schmidt, better known as Atom™, has a similar musical background. He is most well known for his work under the Senor Coconut moniker, but has worked under dozens of other aliases, all with their own sound. Atom™ and Tobias met around 1986, while both were still living in Frankfurt. The pre-techno scene was blossoming when they met in a studio. In 1990, Tobias was the engineer who helped mix and record Atom™&#39;s first release ever. As a natural consequence, Tobias and Atom™ started to work together. Strangely, they collaborated not so much in a studio environment, but mostly playing improvised electronic music concerts. In 1992 they recorded probably one of the very first live techno recordings ever, the 12-inch &#34;Elektroniikkaa&#34;, which soon became an underground anthem. Even though their paths separated for a while in the &#39;90s, with Atom™ moving to Santiago de Chile and Tobias relocating to Berlin, they reconnected their machines on a live stage again in 2003 at Mutek in Chile. Even though they had stopped working together for almost 10 years, the reactivation worked perfectly and they decided to share the stage more often. They have been playing many concerts worldwide since the successful re-launch in 2003, including appearances at Berghain, The Bunker, and Labyrinth. Their live sets are always completely improvised, both immersing into the unknown territory of the club, the audience and the sound. 
Mike Servito
(Ghostly/Bunker :: NYC)  Mike Servito is from a very special yet temporary and partially lost fertile crescent of techno / house / party DJing. It was a time when raves were still a fresh idea, almost felt like a revolution, and DJs like Claude Young, D Wynn, Derrick Carter and Mike Huckaby were informing an upcoming generation. If you look directly to that inspired generation you will find the lost threads of Detroit Techno, House and beyond, you will find a group of DJs with insanely deep mixing skills, the ability to rock almost any kind of party with an improvisational approach that is so skilled it makes everything seem so well thought out that even they don&#39;t know where their set will go. But, it will take you there! In the future, this special generation of deep midwest mixers will be remembered and revered as the wizards they are, long after the trendy players have lost their luster. Detroit never forgot about Mike Servito, his upfront dirty deep and bitchy taste has had an impact on Detroit nightlife for over a decade. From debuting in 1995 at Dat&#39;s Poorboy parties, to being a resident at blackbx and Ghostly&#39;s Untitled (along with Derek Plaslaiko, Tadd Mullinix, Matthew Dear, and Ryan Elliott), contributing to the bizarrely popular, wild and free Dorkwave, and progressing that concept into Sass (the hippest queer party in Detroit at the time), to blowing minds at Interdimensional Transmissions&#39; No Way Back parties, Servito has made his impression. Moving to Brooklyn, Detroit&#39;s loss has been their gain, as he has found a proper home with a new residency at the Bunker, and worldwide representation from Beyond Booking. 
Carlos Souffront
(Interdimensional Transmissions :: SF)  Carlos Souffront is a music gourmet, a true DJ&#39;s DJ. His taste is rich and vast and he has the unique ability to create deeply rhythmic narratives that offer unexpected and exotic spices. He mastered his deep mixing skills with a cassette deck and a belt drive turntable in his father&#39;s den in Troy, home of contemporaries such as Mike Servito, Tadd Mullinex and Matt Dear. Equally entrenched in indie rock, post punk, experimental music, ambient, rock, house, and techno, Carlos was always a man of many worlds - with an ability to traverse though them with an unique imagination. There is a mood to his search within sound, something that is heavy, deep yet gritty. Like many Caribbean transplants that ends up in northern colder climates, he wonders where our rhythmic complexity is. For him it is effortless and endlessly surprising to the listener. Carlos is an important component of the Interdimensional Transmissions parties, bringing a loose yet tight moody deepness and an ever unexpected edge. At the original No Way Back party, he demanded truth in advertising, pushing us to and then past the 12 hour mark. He has participated in the studio with Ectomorph, and also performed alongside some of their live performances. It is all too rare to find someone within the electronic music spectrum that can be called an original, that you can only really explain to someone who experienced them on the dance floor, usually just by saying &#34;that&#39;s so&#34; and saying their name. Carlos is one of those rarities. 
Jason Kendig
(Honey Soundsystem / Mr. INTL :: SF)  Jason Kendig is a resident DJ at Honey Soundsystem and MR.INTL label co-owner with Andy Butler of Hercules and Love Affair, as well as their guest DJ on recent tours. He&#39;s played with Horse Meat Disco in London and at Club Lux in Lisbon, Tripod in Dublin, Pratersauna and Fluc Wanne in Vienna, Berghain in Berlin and Hafen 2 in Frankfurt. He&#39;s known to bring an extremely wide range old and new school disco, house and techno.

Popscene &amp; MIGHTY presents 
PENGUIN PRISON DJ SET
w/ Aaron Axelsen Popscene

Even if you never find out what a Penguin Prison is, there’s no denying Chris Glover aka Penguin Prison has made a brilliant record. If you’re a fan of New York disco, as accessible as it is angular, all burbling bass lines, resonant rhythms, shimmering synths and heavenly melodies, then you’ll love the new Penguin Prison album.
Imagine, if you will, Chic produced by James Murphy, or a collaboration between Prince and The Human League. It is some measure of Penguin Prison’s skills in the studio, on vocals and in terms of songwriting, that such illusory marvels have been achieved on this superb self-titled collection, that some critics have gone as far as to hail it a modern day Off The Wall masterpiece.
“It’s not a concept album about Michael,” says Prison, or maybe we should call him Penguin, of his all-time hero “But it’s definitely been influenced by him.”
To say he was an early starter would be an understatement. From the age of 10 he was singing in the local gospel choir. When he was 11, he got an agent and began recording jingles. By 12, he had learned to play guitar and was into punk rock, the American variety – bands such as Green Day, NOFX and Bad Religion. He even performed as a teen at the legendary CBGBs with his band The Museum.
Chris became Penguin Prison at the start of 2009. It wasn’t long before he earned a reputation as remixer du jour for the likes of Marina and the Diamonds, Goldfrapp and Passion Pit. He agrees that he conferred NY kudos especially on the British artists, and admits his favorite remix was for Jamiroquai, adding that the secret to a good remix is “to throw everything away from the original track and start from scratch”.
It was inevitable that Chris would then make music of his own, which he began in late 2009. You can hear the spectacular results on the debut Penguin Prison album, which sounds to all intents and purposes like a Greatest Hits collection, so chock-full it is of catchy hooks and classic pop choruses. There is Multi-Millionaire, which is about “being rich even if you’ve got no money” and one titled Don’t Fuck With My Money that features Jackson-style percussive gasps and a lyric that pushes the envelope. “I was worried it was too crazy – ‘Can I really say that?’ People said leave it in, so I did. “All my lyrics are sarcastic but serious as well,” he adds. “So I’m really saying ‘don’t fuck with my money’! Because if you try to, it’s not going to be good…”You are most cordially invited to attend a Majestic Reception &amp; Musical Revue featuring…

“If you like Jane Austen — and Madonna — you’ll love Her Rebel Highness… The elaborate costumes and 6-inch-high powdered wigs give the high-energy show a sort of “Beach Blanket Babylon” meets “Material Girl” feel, with some strong feminist themes thrown in for good measure.” - Alameda News

(LUCIANO)     With the release of his landmark CD &#34;Where There Is Life&#34; in 1995, Luciano emerged as one of the most important reggae singers in decades and the greatest hope for roots reggae&#39;s survival in the digital dancehall era. Since that much acclaimed release, Luciano&#39;s music has been consistently praised for imparting sentiments of spiritual salvation, Rastafarian edification and African repatriation.(NATIVE ELEMENTS)      San Francisco&#39;s reggae favorite Native Elements (now in their 10th year as a cohesive unit) never fail to bring positivity and niceness to all of their music gatherings. As recording artist&#39;s they spin a curious fabric of lovers rock, roots and conscious dancehall wrapped cozily in a bright &#34;frisco-pino&#34; treatment. A family before anything else Native Elements strives to make their show a warm and inviting experience for all; young and old, blue and green and everything in between.(INDUBIOUS)Rising up out out of the fertile soil of Southern Oregon&#39;s Rogue Valley, the group of Intergalatic Reggae Revolutionaries known as Indubious come to spread high vibes through their earth-shattering sound.

Why Participate?
With current and projected future demands on limited global resources, sustainability has evolved from an issue of corporate social responsibility to a business imperative.
Björn Stigson, senior advisor and former President, World Business Council for Sustainable Development   
This is not about having a good reputation, it’s because it’s good for the business. We have a strong belief that a high social performance leads to a high financial performance.
Clara Gaymard, chief executive officer and president, GE France
After social enterprises, social ventures, and social entrepreneurship, the most recent wave toward social and financial convergence are for-profit models emerging around the globe as faster vehicles toward social impact. This wave awakened $400 Billion in impact investing by 2017 (according to JP Morgan), and a tsunami of socially minded professionals, leaders, and innovators seeking to make a living making positive change in the world.
We have Social Impact Bonds, Benefit Corporations, Sustainable Design, Green Tech, Offices of Social Innovation, Occupy, Social and Mobile Technologies, Crowd Sourcing, Collaborative Brands, and many other interrelated forces that seem to be stirring us in the same direction. But how does it all happen? How do we converge?
Figure it out with us%.

The exciting and uplifting Hawaiian singer Paula Fuga makes her Ashkenaz debut with her longtime collaborators in the Mike Love Trio. Whether just singing and strumming her ukulele, or backed by the Trio’s full reggae-world beats, Fuga’s unique voice and vision stand out. She combines her lyrics with music rooted in Hawaiian folk tradition, reggae, world, and Polynesian sounds that have brought international attention since the release of her first album, “Lilikoi,” in 2006. More recently Fuga has opened Jack Johnson’s stateside tours, and he and Ziggy Marley sang on her most recent recording: Johnson dueted on the hit “Country Road,” and Marley appeared on a new arrangement of his father Bob Marley’s “High Tide or Low Tide.” Fuga’s latest recording, “Misery’s End,” has received rave reviews, and the title song is one of the highlights of her current concert.
Her longtime musical partner, singer-guitarist Mike Love (of bands such as Dubkonscious), and his Trio are backing her as she performs at festivals from Oregon’s Northwest World Reggae Festival to Southern California’s Doheny Surf Festival. Tonight’s show is a rare chance to see Fuga in a full concert.
Fuga comes from a humble beginning, surrounded by the blues and gospel music of Louisiana, before becoming rooted and matured in the cultural richness and diversity of Hawaii (she lives on the north shore of Oahu) and eventually touring internationally and to both American coasts. Along the way she has chosen to serve as a musical ambassador for her Hawaiian culture. She uses her talent as an instrument to help bring about positive social change within her islands and beyond: performing at benefit concerts for charter schools, instilling the Hawaiian culture in the generations to come, and generally being a beacon of the meditative and healing powers of her people. Fuga is the recipient of a Na Hoku Hano Hano Award, Hawaii’s highest and most prestigious musical honor.
 “My life is a miracle,” Fuga said in an interview for a Hawaiian publication. “I was homeless on the beach by the time I was 5 years old. I lived in a car, in all kinds of weird, crazy situations. But I truly believed that good things would happen to me if I just kept being a good person… I know how miraculous it is for me to be where I am. And this is just the beginning for me; I’m just getting started. And I’m so grateful that Jack (Johnson) likes having me around and sees something in me that’s good. I feel so lucky.”

Inspiring, uplifting, and playfully powerful, Saritah’s live shows are colorful celebrations of life and harmony. A festival favorite, Saritah loves to connect with the audience, and her vocals deliver lyrical affirmations, inspirations, and observations with a captivating blend of attitude and grace. She draws from her most recent CD, “Ancient Forward,” a strong and diverse collection of songs that move from dancehall to roots reggae to acoustic soul, ska and more. She is also unveiling selections from her next, soon-to-be-released CD, recorded in the Bay Area after last summer’s her first West Coast tour last summer.
Born in Seoul, South Korea, the country of her mother’s heritage, Saritah grew up by the Indian Ocean in Perth, Australia. Now based in Melbourne, she has built a loyal fan base around the world since the release of her debut album, “Gratitude,” in 2004. A traveler from the time she was a few months old, she has always had a global perspective and has been exposed to and influenced by a diversity of music and culture from around the world. “I make music to reconnect people with their hearts,” Saritah says, “to remind people of their power, their beauty, their divinity. I totally believe we chose to be in these times here on earth. We all are co-creators of our world and our reality.”

FIGURE
Small-town producer Josh Gard has had a long history in music, but lately he has been rapidly rising up the ranks of all things bass. Just a few short years ago he donned the name of Figure and began making electro house, and he has since become a regular name in the realms of dubstep and drumstep. Scoring positions in Beatport’s top ten charts may have gotten him recognition, but a fantastic amount of praise has been raining down on him lately as some of the leading artists in electronic music have valued his live performance skills as some of the best in the business. It’s those kind of endorsements that load up Figure’s tour calendar and make him a moving target that’s hard to put crosshairs on…

RUSS LIQUID
Set apart from other up-and-coming West Coast bass music producers by his extensive world-touring history and performance experience, Russ Liquid brings a much-needed injection of melody and emotion to the thriving dance floor community. Classically trained on the piano, trumpet, saxophone and flute, Russ Liquid applies the colorful tones of instrumental music to the realm of beats with dance floor-rocking results. This talented producer has found an entirely new palette to “paint” with, and now he seeks to bridge the gap between classical and modern music with new electronic technology and sonic possibilities.

Louie Vega is the Miles Davis of dance music. Like the impossible to categorize Davis, Vega is constantly reinventing himself and revolutionizing music itself in the process. During his nearly two-decade long career, Vega has crafted some of the most innovative singles in dance music history (“The Nervous Track”, “It’s Alright”, “I Feel It” and “You Can Do It”), kick started genres like soulful house (“Beautiful People,” “I Get Lifted”), and revitalized the careers of legends like Roy Ayers, George Benson and Tito Puente.
Music has been in Anané’s blood since growing up in the Cape Verdean capital of Santiago. “My aunts and uncles were known as the Xalinos and they made most of the musical instruments on the island, such as guitars, violins, and the uncommon Cavaqinho, a small four-string guitar,” she said about her musical lineage. Anané discovered her talent for singing during family gatherings called “serenades” where people would play guitars and percussion instruments and sing a “morna,” a melancholic but beautiful ode to past times spent on the islands.
Anané eventually decided to bring her talents to New York City where, armed with nothing more than a bag full of clothes and a heart full of dreams, she immersed herself in the city’s club culture. She met DJ/Producer Louie Vega, who tapped her as an integral member of the Elements of Life Collective, and Anané used that as a stepping stone to an international career that has included appearances at Japan’s world-renowned Blue Note, Europe’s celebrated Montreux Jazz Festival, Finland’s Pori Jazz, Holland’s North Sea Jazz Festival, Cape Town’s Jazz and Britain’s Womad Festival. Perhaps her biggest gig yet was in 2007 when world-famous entertainment empire Cirque De Soleil personally approached Anané to perform the opening song for the Super Bowl XLII pre-game show. Her performance of “One Dream” was seen by more than 140 million people worldwide.Step right up and get your tickets to

Garth (Wicked) All Vinyl, All Night Long in the Loft
at Public Works
Saturday Aug 18, 2012
10pm-late 
21+
161 Erie StreetGarth Quarterly at Public Works LAUNCH PARTYDriving a car load of vinyl from LA- house, disco, classics, acid, nu disco, spaced out jamz.It is all too often these days where DJ&#39;s are given 45 minute sets and we have even seen promoters listing &#34;2 hour set&#34; for DJ duo&#39;s. Well that&#39;s a bit ridiculous and we are having Garth play all night and taking you on a journey through house, disco, classics, acid, nu disco, spaced out jamz and whatever else he manages to throw in the crates for his journey back up to SF to rock it. And yes- we are all really excited about this.

Legend status Garth Bio here:Before moving to Los Angeles in 2010, Garth spent two decades in San Francisco fanning the flames of conscious hell raising that existed there in generations past. Parties with his stamp include a coveted ten year residency at Come Unity, thirteen legendary years with the Wicked Sound System and since 2005, Back2Back with right hand man Jeno. His sound is a definitive fusion of Acid House, Space Disco &amp; Psyche Rock. He is behind the monthly SPANK! parties in LA with TK Disco.The Wicked crew reformed in 2011 for a 13 city Twenty Years of Disco Glory Tour of the States &amp; Japan. Garth also spent a good chunk of 2010/2011 touring extensively with DJ Harvey in Australia and Japan.Bringing UK sound system culture to San Francisco in 1991, Wicked&#39;s lawless full moon beach parties ushered in an era of Acid House hysteria that ripped through the west coast and spread into the heartland. Wicked are credited widely with kick-starting the City&#39;s rave scene in the early 90&#39;s, cementing its reputation as the red headed step child of Disco.Scoring a Tony Andrews designed Turbosound rig, they toured in a &#39;47 Greyhound bus whose previous owners were a gospel choir hitting the road to spread their own gospel across the States. Wicked was the pioneering sound system at Burning Man in 1995.They brought the best DJs the world had to offer to San Francisco including the first time Bay Area performances of House/Disco luminaries like Tony Humphries, DJ Harvey, Louis Vega, Francois K, Joe Clausel, Roger S, Robert Owens, Stacy Pullen, DJ Pierre and K Alexi. Garth holds court at many of the world&#39;s best nightclubs including Eleven, Mago, Gold, Yellow, Townsend, 1015, The Roxy, Twilo, Fabric, The End, Horsemeat Disco, Sublevel, Thirtynine Hotel, Rex, Room, Lux &amp; Zouk. He has been voted amongst America&#39;s top DJs in Urb, XLR8R and DJ Magazines. For many years he pioneered all night Dub sets on the only renegade system permitted at Reggae on the River where Jamaican legends Mikey Dread and Junior Reid stopped by the bus to rock the mic.The same bus provided inspiration for a record label. Since &#39;98 Grayhound has released 50+ singles documenting an edgier West Coast sound. Artists include Wicked (Garth, Markie, Jeno &amp; Thomas), Rocket, Perry Farrell, ETI, DJ Harvey, The Glimmers &amp; Ray Mang, Darryl Pandy, Michoacan, DJ Rasoul, Nectar, Stranger, Steve Kotey &amp; EBE. Many recording artists launched their careers on the label.His breakout anthem with E.T.I. &#39;Twenty Minutes of Disco Glory&#39; shook things up internationally, praised by Muzik Magazine as one of the best dance singles of &#39;96. Since then he has produced 60 records under various pseudonyms working with Anthony Mansfield, Eric James (Rocket), Rob Doten (Crosstown Traffic) and Markie Mark or Jeno (Wicked). His remixes include Freeland, The Units, Faithless, Halo Varga, The Glimmers, Rob Rives, Dada Munchamonkey, Perry Farrell (Janes Addiction), Yabby You, Mutabaruka and Tribe Called Quest.He has compiled and mixed albums for Om, NRK, Thrive &amp; Grayhound. Grayhound productions have been licensed to countless DJ mix CDs and Garth&#39;s music can be found in two films - SF rave flick &#39;Groove&#39; and Gus Van Sant&#39;s &#39;Speedway Junky&#39;.Since 2007 he and collector/dealer James Glass have been waving the flag for Golden Goose re-edits, raiding their record collections &amp; respectfully placing Disco/Rock obscurities under the knife as King &amp; Hound.Remaining true to the original art form, he can be found playing all-vinyl sets out in Hawaii, Japan, Fiji, Korea, Spain, England, Greece, Portugal, France, Belgium, Germany, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Singapore, Thailand, even Indonesia and Malaysia, turning parties out upon request.DescriptionGarth is a vinyl archivist and pioneering dance music DJ who rose to prominence with the Wicked Sound System. He is largely credited with both defining and capturing the sound of San Francisco&#39;s Acid House movement in the 1990s. As a recording artist, the bulk of his productions &amp; edits can be found on his Grayhound &amp; Golden Goose labels.

Ox from the stable is an unsuspected hero’s journey of a poor farmer boy, who finds himself searching trans-continent for his captured wife.  The main character ascends from stability, into the unknown, battling both the tangible endeavors of western expansion and the inner motives of love and vengeance.  Full of Taoist philosophy, Native-American spirituality and Japanese-pacific imagery, the poor farmer boy finds himself as one of the last practitioners of the native Lydian’s way of life.  Finally casting the western General away, he finds love and the answers he never anticipated.

Ashkenaz is excited to host our second annual celebration of the life and music of Jerry Garcia, in which an all-star lineup of local musicians perform their favorite Garcia tunes! They explore songs both classic and rediscovered with a highly collaborative feel, much in the spirit of Jerry himself.
The August date was chosen in honor of both the birth and the passing of Garcia (8/1/42–8/9/95). Though he never played at Ashkenaz, we have a long history with Garcia’s music. Since the ’90s Ashkenaz has hosted Grateful Dead Nights and featured bands that pay homage to the music of Garcia, the Grateful Dead, and scores of acts who have followed in their footsteps.
The event is a Community Benefit Night to raise funds for Ashkenaz. Beginning with a salute to Bob Dylan’s 70th birthday in May 2011, musicians have donated their time and talents in a creative and inspiring series of tributes, every couple of months honoring a different music great and supporting the nonprofit local institution that is Ashkenaz.Saturday, August 31stLive At The Pagoda 2012 Summer Music Series V.6featuring live performances byA N A   T I J O U X

Rodney Atkins will be the first country star to play at San Jose City College when he headlines this year’s Black Tie &amp; Boots Benefit to support student programs at San Jose City College.



 



 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rodney Atkins




Atkins will be the highlight of the evening that will begin fundraising efforts to support the San Jose City College Athletic Program.  
The September 7, 2012 concert will begin a tradition at SJCC that will be the premier annual fund raising event for student programs at the college.
According to Greg Nelson, Vice President of Administration, “most tickets will be sold to corporate partners with some tickets available to the public. However, if you want to be sure to get a seat, you need to purchase a corporate sponsorship,” he said.
Award-winning singer/songwriter Rodney Atkins has an impressive track record with hitting on sentiments that strike a chord with the country listener. Atkins has landed six No. 1 hits, including the most recent platinum-selling chart-topper, “Take A Back Road,” and has over five million single sales in the past five years alone. The new album, TAKE A BACK ROAD (released Oct. 4, 2011), has helped propel Rodney to even bigger heights with the out-of-the-box smash, “Take A Back Road,” and current single, “He’s Mine,” a clever tune focused on the unconditional love of a son and sense of pride when recognizing personal responsibility for the child’s mannerisms, no matter how questionable his actions may be.
In 2007, Rodney was named ACM’s Top New Male Vocalist while also garnering back-to-back recognition with Billboard‘s Most Played Song of the Year Award for “If You’re Going Through Hell” (2006) and “Watching You” (2007). Since the start of his success, Rodney has appeared on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, The Early Show on CBS, Good Morning America, Fox &amp; Friends, CNN Headline News and many more. He is also the national spokesperson the National Council for Adoption. For more information on Rodney Atkins, visit www.rodneyatkins.com.
Black Tie &amp; Boots ticket will include valet parking, a seated meal at 7:30p.m., and the concert at 8:15 p.m. and will be SJCC’s largest fundraiser of the year, Nelson said.
Limited tickets go on sale July 1st to the general public for $165 per ticket or $1,500 per table. Tickets can be purchased up until September 7th. 
“The proceeds go toward supporting the athletic program which include, program improvements, facility upgrades and faculty development. The event is absolutely crucial to the vitality of the program because of  reductions in funding from the state,” he said. 
President Dr. Barbara Kavalier said, “the College has come to the point that we must rely on the  support of fundraising activities like Black Tie &amp; Boots to support the programs within the college”.
“I encourage people to come out and see Rodney Atkins, have a good time and support our community and our students,” Kavalier said.
For more information about becoming a corporate sponsor or ticket sales, contact Nelson at 408-288-3187 greg.nelson@sjcc.edu or 408-288-3723. To purchase tickets go to http://blacktiebootssjcc.eventbrite.com

Le Petit Trianon

 &#34;I am reminded over and over again of the tremendous value that learning music has for the young. Today&#39;s children are confronted on all sides by numerous domestic and social challenges.

Paula Fuga + Mike Love Trio
AUGUST 7TH 
Paula Fuga is a musician on a mission. Though many play music for the platitudes or acclaim, Paula plays music for a culture--spreading the thoughtful and evocative voice of the Hawaiian people across the world. Not content to be merely a widely respected artist, Paula has taken on the mantle of cultural ambassador---using her talent as an instrument to help bring about positive social change within her islands and beyond: performing at benefit concerts for charter schools, instilling the Hawaiian culture in the generations to come and, generally, being a beacon of the meditative and healing powers of her people. 


From a humble beginning, surrounded by the blues and gospel music of Louisiana, rooted and matured in the cultural richness and diversity of Hawaii, and eventually touring internationally and to both American coasts have infused Paula Fuga with a voice that is wet with soul from America’s Bible Belt, ripened by the various textures of paradise, and cultivated with sophistication through a sovereign journey.
 
On her independent record label, Pakipika Productions, Paula Fuga has managed to release her unique flavor of music around the world, earning an astounding and dedicated fan base, while collecting impressive critical acclaim, including a Na Hoku Hano Hano Award––Hawaii’s highest and most prestigious musical honor. Since then,Paula has collaborated with the likes of Jack Johnson and Ziggy Marley and now stands poised and ready for her inevitable emergence as a Roots Music star for the 21st Century.

SALON CLASSIQUE
Summer Concert - Trios by the Pool
Saturday, August 18th, 2012 at 3pm

Kindly hosted by Ram and Denise in their private home in Palo Alto



Franz Schubert: Piano Trio in B flat
Ludwig van Beethoven: Variations for Cello and Piano
Joaquin Turina: Piano Trio No. 2
performed by
Karsten Windt, Violin and Introductions
Angela Lee, Cello
Avi Downes, Piano

While many musical organizations close the doors for vacation in August, Ram and Denise kindly open their beautiful house and terrace for SALON CLASSIQUE. Come enjoy a musical afternoon in sunny Palo Alto. Sit inside close to the musicians, or on the deck by the pool and listen to great masterworks for piano trio. Wine and refreshments will be served as well as hors d&#39;ouevres during the intermission.

About the program:
Schubert&#39;s Piano Trio in B flat is a jewel of the genre. The composer performed it himself in a private salon among his friends in Vienna, where he premiered most of his chamber music. A few decades earlier Beethoven had written his virtuosic Variations for Cello and Piano. They are based on a theme from Mozart&#39;s opera The Magic Flute that everybody was whistling in the streets at that time. Our final piece is the Second Piano Trio by great romantic Spanish composer Joaquin Turina. He had acquired his skills in bustling Paris of the early 20th century and became a master in combining French impressionist refinement with the passion of Spanish folklore.

 

About the musicians:
Angela Lee, cellist of The Lee Trio, and Karsten Windt, founding director of SALON CLASSIQUE and former 1st. violinist of the Deutsche Symphony Berlin, belong to the core of the SALON CLASSIQUE musicians. This time they are joined by pianist Avi Downes, whom we welcome back on the podium after the birth of her second child. After studying in San Francisco, Vienna and Cologne, Avi has been playing chamber music throughout her career and received numerous awards in international competitions.
 
About the series:
SALON CLASSIQUE, an affiliate of San Francisco Friends of Chamber Music, is a concert series that brings masterworks of chamber music from the concert hall back to its original setting: the intimate environment of a private venue. We provide informative introductions to the music as part of the program.

About the hosts:
When inviting their friends for the legendary annual spring party, Ram and Denise do not only offer delicious food, but also have some friends performing live music for their guests. The audience can sit around the musicians from many different sides, with the doors open to the deck and garden, which makes their home the perfect venue for a chamber music concert in the summer. Thank you for hosting this SALON CLASSIQUE concert, Ram and Denise. 

Reservation:
Seating is limited. Advance payment by credit card or check is required to secure your seat. Follow the link at the top of this page. For questions call (415) 867-9416 or write an email to: mail@musicpresentation.com.

Few records make such an instant impression as Home Again, the debut album by the British, liquid-voiced soul singer Michael Kiwanuka. Immersing the listener in a sound that is both modern and at the same time as familiar as the classics, it manages to strike the balance between being contemporary and somehow utterly timeless.
 
For Kiwanuka, key musical touchstones include Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Shuggie Otis, Roberta Flack’s First Take, Bill Withers’ Live At Carnegie Hall, and D’Angelo’s modern soul landmark Voodoo. Citing the latter album in particular as Exhibit A in refuting suggestions that his listening tastes are rooted exclusively in the 1970s, Kiwanuka calmly shrugs off any “retro” accusations that might be levelled at his music.
 
&#34;The truth is there was no intention behind any of it,” he states. “There was no intention for my voice to sound old. The songs come out like they do because I like the sound of stuff like that. I didn’t start writing songs to get a record deal. I wrote songs to express myself and they ended up sounding old.&#34;
 
Moreover, to Kiwanuka’s impressionable young ears (he was born in 1986), even the music of the past was fresh to him. “To me, those records sounded new,” he says. “Growing up, I didn’t have records at home. I didn’t even know any Beatles albums. For me, it was all completely brand new music, even though it was recorded decades ago.
 
Born in Muswell Hill, London to Ugandan émigré parents, Michael Kiwanuka was brought up in a home from which music was largely absent, with his first introduction to rock (Nirvana, Radiohead) arriving at the same time as he began to hang with the skater kids in the north London suburb during his early teenage years. Later coming across a soul compilation album given away with a music monthly, he was enthralled by the sound of Otis Redding’s studio talkback discussions with his engineer while recording an outtake version of &#34;(Sittin’ On) The Dock of The Bay.&#34; From this point on, he resolved to make music that sounded raw and authentic.
 
Though deeply into soul and jazz, he found real inspiration in the cross-pollination of the two styles with folk in the music of Bill Withers. “Bill Withers was very rootsy and earthy,” he points out, “but people branded him as a soul singer. To me, he was a folk artist. So that encouraged me to keep going, ‘cause I didn’t know where I would fit in as a black guy with an acoustic guitar.
 
In beginning to perform on the acoustic circuit around London, Kiwanuka quickly attracted interest and made connections, not least with his current manager who in turn garnered the attention of Communion Records, the label that in 2011 released the singer’s first two acclaimed EPs, Tell Me a Tale and I’m Getting Ready.
 
Both of these EPs – as with Home Again – were produced by Paul Butler (The Bees) in his vintage equipment-stuffed basement studio at his house in Ventnor on the Isle Of Wight. Together the pair played almost every instrument to be heard on the album, with Butler’s remarkably intimate, detailed productions – adorned with everything from flute to brass to sitar to aching strings – perfectly matching Kiwanuka’s visions for his songs. “The way we made the record was very modern,” the singer points out. “There was loads of editing. We manipulated it to get exactly what we wanted.&#34;
 
From the opening bars of the stirring &#34;Tell Me a Tale,&#34; it is instantly clear that Home Again is a very special album. While its more upbeat characteristics are embodied in the Prince Buster-like loping of the lovelorn but irresistibly catchy &#34;Bones&#34; and the rolling soul groove of &#34;I’ll Get Along,&#34; elsewhere it proves itself to be a record of real stripped-down beauty. In &#34;I Won’t Lie,&#34; with its gospel-infused echoes of The Staples Singers, Kiwanuka offers something akin to a modern spiritual, while in &#34;Rest&#34; he turns in a tender “love lullaby” and in &#34;Always Waiting,&#34; he blends classical elements with the confessional intimacy of Roberta Flack.
 
It is with the title track of Home Again, however, that Michael Kiwanuka feels the record’s sounds and themes are ultimately encapsulated. “That’s the song that really for me ties everything together,” he says. “It’s one of the earliest songs I wrote for the album and even though I progressed and changed stuff in the studio, it was the one I could never throw away. Like a lot of them, it’s a hopeful song. I use home as the metaphor for contentment and peace within.&#34;
 
Other parts of the record, on the other hand, find Kiwanuka struggling for peace of mind and using his songs as a form of self-empowerment, not least in the soulful &#34;I’m Getting Ready,&#34; the darker, unburdening &#34;Any Day Will Do Fine&#34; and the self-explanatory &#34;Worry Walks Beside Me.&#34; “It can really paralyze you, if you worry too much,” the singer admits. “I do tend to overthink things. All of these songs are me talking to myself, really. Trying to encourage myself to believe.&#34;
 
On the evidence of the stunning Home Again, of course, Kiwanuka is clearly not a musician who should be wrestling with doubts. It is an album that is set to make the liquid-voiced singer an international name and touch its listeners in the same way as his favourite records inspired Michael Kiwanuka himself.
 
“I’d just like for the songs to mean something in people’s lives,” he concludes. “That for me is what music ultimately is for. All of our favourite records, you can remember where you were when you first heard them. Or they might remind you of a time or someone. My hope is that these songs will move people.&#34;

MARK HUMMEL 
and THE BLUES SURVIVORS
Featuring Little Charlie   
 

 
Friday, August 3, 2012--8pm
 
The past two decades has seen the emergence of young harmonica-led blues bands. In California, groups that draw their inspiration from the Chicago school but add elements of jump blues and rock &#39;n&#39; roll into the mix have come up with an exciting new style of West Coast blues. In Oakland, the northern capital of California blues, resides the incredibly powerful harmonica player and vocalist Mark Hummel, leader of The Blues Survivors, who has been a major force in shaping and defining this musical genre.Mark Hummel is a road warrior - a true Blues Survivor. Along the way, he has crafted his own trademark harmonica sound - a subtle combination of tone, phrasing and attack combined with a strong sense of swing. While Mark is new to Electro Fi Records, his earlier albums, constant touring and appearances at the major blues festivals have firmly established his solid reputation around the US and Europe. &#34;Mark Hummel is simply one of the best harmonica players working today!...&#34;  - Huey Lewis

Overview
 
We&#39;ve seen many shifts in ways to control sound over the millenia; everything from animal skins and bones to hacked Game Boys and everywhere in between. We find ourselves positioned at an interesting point in time for how we manipulate sound in a post-instrument world. The topic of alternative musical interfaces has been discussed by those attempting to redefine how we&#39;ve shaped sound since the tribal era, but the discourse seems to be thriving. We&#39;ve brought together three specialists (see below) who have dedicated large portions of their lives to the noble task of constructing new musical interfaces and pushing musicians to interact with their instruments in new and different fashions.
 
The object of this evening is to gather together those interested in redefining our physical relationship to sounds and music. If you are interested in audio we recommend that you come join in the discussion with us.

West Side Story:
More than fifty years ago, a show about New York City changed musical theater forever. Now, it&#39;s making history once again.From the first notes to the final breath, West Side Story is one of the most memorable musicals and greatest love stories of all time. Arthur Laurents&#39; book remains as powerful, poignant and timely as ever. The score by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim a collection of standards that includes &#34;Tonight,&#34; &#34;America,&#34; &#34;Maria,&#34; &#34;I Feel Pretty&#34; and &#34;Somewhere&#34; is widely regarded as one of the best ever written. And the extraordinary, Tony-winning choreography by Jerome Robbins completely changed the language of Broadway dance.This groundbreaking new production, directed by Jeff Lowe, offers a bold new design that builds on the show&#39;s raw power and emotion to create a fresh experience unlike any that came before it. Don&#39;t miss this thrilling presentation of a matchless work of art.
See you at the theatre!

Biography
Chicago has house, Detroit techno, Berlin minimal and London a long history of rave culture. But Melbourne’s dance producers are chameleons, mashing up a multitude of Trans-Atlantic sounds with an irreverence peculiar to them. Tornado Wallace subscribes to this very individualism but, even within his hometown, he’s considered an anomaly.
The elusive and enigmatic DJ/producer is discreetly taking on the world with his hybrid of house, techno and deep groove with the slinky disco playa responsible for three standout releases in 2010, all supported by contemporaries such as Jimpster, Mr Scruff, The Revenge, Eric Duncan, Horse Meat Disco, Greg Wilson, Matthew Dear, Mark E, Eddie C, DJ T and more. First was the Tornado Never Dies EP on Sleazy Beats followed by the triumphant Paddlin’ EP on Jimpster’s Delusions Of Grandeur which topped Juno’s charts for a number of weeks and was listed in their top 50 tracks for 2010. His love affair with Delusions of Grandeur continued with ‘Always Twirling’, which reached similar heights, resonating with music lovers from all corners of the globe.
2011 looks just as bright with his next two releases on The Revenge’s Instruments of Rapture and Delusions of Grandeur set to solidify him as the leading figure in Melbourne’s resurgence on the world stage.
Tornado has also lent his creative spin to other artist’s with remixes for Eddie C (Hometaping is Killing Music), Alex Agore (Kolour), Loin Brothers (Future Classics), Nile Delta (Cutters), JD73 (Z Records), Cut Copy (Modular) and Mike Callander (Haul).
In childhood he learnt to play piano, saxophone, guitar and the drums – and performed in a high school jazz band. He took up electronic music production at fifteen-years-old, teaching himself the basics on some outdated computer software. Knowing straight away that it was for him, he passionately continues down this path nine years on without looking back.
After collecting records throughout his teen years, he was thrown into the DJing world at 18-years-old, as a favour to a friend that needed a spot filled. Since, he has established himself the go-to-DJ and has become a regular on Melbourne’s circuit. He now has residencies at Melbourne’s longest running clubs Revolver and One Six One, and co-runs the monthly C Grade parties at the Mercat Basement, where his eight-hour sets with good friends Otologic have inspired a neo-underground scene sweeping through his hometown. Gigs at Space – Ibiza, Plastic People – London, Watergate – Berlin, Milan, Bucharest to name but a few, remixes for Cut Copy and Mike Callander, plus the coveted Resident Advisor Podcast, Australia is surely in for a treat this summer
 
 
 
 
 


About this classical Persian music concert:Featured in a private residence in Los Gatos California, this concert will be an exclusive event with very limited capacity featuring musicians Pezhham Akhavass, Kourosh Taghlavi and Saeed Kamjoo.  This concert will be a deep exploration into traditional/classical Persian music with this unique opportunity to hear this trio in the San Francisco Bay Area.


About Classical Persian Music Persian classical music is organized through the various melodies in a number of different tonal spaces called Dastgah. The traditional music of Iran is based on the Radif, which is a collection of old melodies that have been handed down from the master to the student over generations. Over time, each master&#39;s own interpretation has shaped and added new intrepretations to the standards and also added their own unique style.Persian art music consists of twelve principal musical modal systems that consist of seven dastgāhs and 5 avaz, together making 12 scales.  This concert will be an exploration of &#34;rast pangah&#34; which is one of the dastagahs in Persian classical music.   About the artists Featuring on percussion Pezhham Akhavass, on Setar Kourosh Taghavi and on Kamancheh Saeed Kamjoo, this concert series explores one of the major modes of music called panjgah. Kourosh Taghavi was born in Gorgan, Iran in 1965. After his migration to the United States in 1984 he began studying the Setâr with Ms. Partow Houshmand-Rad. He later had the great fortune to continue his studies of the Setâr and classical music of Iran with Ostad Mohammad Reza Lotfi and Ostad Hossein Alizadeh. These ongoing studies are the source of his unique approach to the art of Iranian music. Taghavi’s passionate and melodic approach to music is the foundation of his many collaborations and recordings with numerous artists performing both the traditional and modern art forms of Iranian music.Taghavi is one of the founding members of Goosheh, Sedâ, and Namâd Ensembles with which he has toured throughout the US, Europe and Asia. He is also a founding member of The Sâyeh Poetry and Music Society. His recent collaborations with renowned master artists such as Hossein Omoumi, Robert Bly and Coleman Barks and prestigious cultural organizations such as San Diego Museum of Art (SDMA), and Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), Konya Mystic Music Festival are some of the highlights of his efforts in promoting Persian classical music and poetry. As a faculty member of San Diego State University, Taghavi taught the Radiff of Persian classical music and oversaw related theses. His new collaboration with the Center for World Music has brought Persian classical music to the school districts of San Diego where he provides public school students with high-quality, hands-on instruction in Persian Classical music. Kourosh has been teaching the Setâr throughout California, lecturing, composing original music for plays, creating compositions based on contemporary Iranian poetry, and recording passionate solo pieces. These are only few of many goals Taghavi has accomplished in his passionate quest for introducing and promoting Persian classical music.Pezhham Akhavass, is a percussionist of Persian instruments Tombak and Daf.  Born in 1980 in Iran, Pezhham began learning music at the age of 5.  With the support of his artist father Mostafa, Pezhham studied with many master teachers of Persian music.  He later graduated with a degree in music from the University in Tehran and traveled the world performing with the renowned vocalist Shahram Nazeri, where he performed in some of the world&#39;s most prestigious venues.  Pezhham&#39;s unique approach to rhythm has distinguised him as one of the innovative artist of his generation.  Pezhham has recorded, performed and toured with master musicians including Hossein Alizadeh, Kayhan Kalhor, Aliakbar Moradi, Imamyar Hassanov, and he has also performed with YoYo Ma in Los Angeles, Ca.  In addition to Tombak and Daf, Pezhham also plays Setar, Oud, Tanbour, Indian Tabla and Gatam. Pezhham is part of the extremely artistic Akhavass family; his father Mostafa is an award winning classical Persian artist granted a doctoral degree by Iran and his brother Pouria is an acclaimed vocalist and Kamanche player who has recorded and performed with Hossein Alizadeh as part of the Hamavayan Ensemble. Pezhham now lives in the San Francisco Bay Area where he teaches, performs, lectures and produces world music concerts.  www.akhavass.comSaeed Kamjoo, born in 1965 in Tehran, Iran, is a Persian musician and composer. He started learning kamanche at the age of seventeen under the supervision of Adeshir Kamkar. He furthered his studies in the instrumental and vocal repertoires of Classical Persian music under the guidance of such renowned masters as Ali Abrak Shekarchi and Ustad Ali Asghar Bahari. He is also a graduate of the School of Fine Arts from Tehran University.His approach to playing kamanche is based on his perception of the values inherent in classical Persian music. Kamjoo&#39;s style of playing kamanche combines creativity and authenticity with innovation. Although his music has its roots in Classical Persian music, he allows himself to explore the new.Kamjoo moved to Montreal, Canada in 1997 and has since been collaborating with various ensembles in Canada, the USA and Europe. He has recorded many albums and performed in numerous music festivals around in  Canada, the USA , Mexico, U.K, France, Germany, Netherlands, Belguim, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, Poland, Greece and Turkey . Saeed Kamjoo has also performed as a guest artist with Dastan Ensemble, one of the most renowned Persian musical groups.  He is a co-founder of Namâd Ensemble.Here is a video from Konya Turkey in 2009 with Namad Ensmeble featuring these three musicians. 
Quartets in the Sky
Monday, September 17th, 2012 at 6pm

 
Kindly hosted by Jerome and Thao Dodson
in their apartment on the San Francisco waterfront

String Quartets by Mendelssohn and Haydn
performed by
Karsten Windt &amp; Yuna Lee, Violin
David Kim, Viola - Angela Lee, Cello
Musical Introductions by Karsten Windt

Those attending the opening concert of the 2012/13 season of Salon Classique will see stunning views of San Francisco Bay. Jerry and Thao Dodson generously open the doors of their penthouse for this very special event in the sky, just a few blocks from the Ferry Building. You are invited to hear two great string quartets by Mendelssohn and Haydn, while the Bay shines in the warm light of a late summer sunset. The concert will be followed by dinner kindly provided by the hosts.
 
About the program:
Our first piece will be the rarely performed String Quartet in E flat written in 1823 by the young Felix Mendelssohn. This charming and fully mature string quartet had remained unpublished for a long time. Much like Mendelssohn&#39;s twelve early string symphonies, it does not appear in his official works catalogue. A late masterpiece by Joseph Haydn, one of the so called &#34;Tost Quartets&#34; Op. 64, will be our second piece, giving the &#34;Father of the String Quartet&#34; the position in the program that he deserves, for being the inventor of the genre and the model for every string quartet composer ever since. 
 


About the artists:
Angela Lee, cellist of The Lee Trio, David Kim from the San Francisco Symphony, and founding director Karsten Windt, violin, have been performing together in many concerts of SALON CLASSIQUE. For this quartet evening they are joined by violinist Yuna Lee, a former member of the Phaedros Quartet.

About the series:
SALON CLASSIQUE, an affiliate of San Francisco Friends of Chamber Music, is a concert series that brings masterworks of chamber music from the concert hall back to its original setting: the intimate environment of a private venue. We provide informative introductions to the music as part of the program. Tax deductible donations to Karsten Windt Music Presentation - Salon Classique can be made by following this link to the SFFCM website. 

About the hosts:
Jerome Dodson is president of Parnassus Investments and a true music-lover. He and his wife, Thao, can often be seen in the audience at the San Francisco Symphony and the San Francisco Opera. Jerry was also president of the board of Musical Days in Forest Hill. In their former home in Forest Hill, the Dodsons were the first to host a concert of SALON CLASSIQUE (Music at Home) in 2010. Thank you, Jerry and Thao, for hosting another event in your beautiful new home.

Both paid and unpaid positions are available for qualified singers with excellent musicianship skills:
Sacred Music Workshop  This chamber chorus is made up of 20 amateur singers (plus four professional section leaders) and performs unaccompanied music in the Renaissance tradition, including modern works.  In addition to preparing for three concert programs per season, the ensemble spends a portion of its 10-12 week rehearsal period studying various aspects of music including vocal technique, sight reading, and history.  Previous repertoire has included Mass for Four Voices (Monteverdi), Nine Advent Motets (Rheinberger), Tenebrae Responses (Victoria), Messe en style ancien (Langlais), Seven Last Words of Christ (Gounod), and Mass in the Dorian Mode (Howells). Rehearsals are held Wednesday evenings in San Francisco.
Third Thursdays Concerts  Not an ensemble per se, this concert series hosts a rotating roster of 4-8 semi-professional singers for intimate performances once per month in the brilliant acoustic of the Porziuncola Nuova in North Beach.  Highlights from the coming season include Canticum canticorum (Palestrina), Prophetiae Sibyllarum (Lassus), Lamentations of Jeremiah (Victoria), motets by Schutz, and works four double-choir. Rehearses Thursday evenings in San Francisco.
Euouae An all-star lineup of fully professional singers performs virtuosic polyphony, one voice on a part, along with medieval chant from 9th and 10th century manuscripts.  This year&#39;s reperoitre include Ockeghem&#39;s Requiem, Josquin&#39;s Nymphes des bois, and a polyphonic Vespers based on music of Dufay.

With its rustic design and menu of classic cocktails, The Parlor feels like a piece of old San Francisco. The timeless design resembles the style of the early 1900s: private booths, brick walls, exposed steel beams, a well weathered floor, antique chandeliers lit with Edison bulbs, distressed tables, dark walnut stained bar, and bar stools with rivets give The Parlor a rustic foundation, while button-tufted leather banquettes, felt and velvet fabrics lend a softer, burlesque vibe.

A beginners&#39; guitar class with a unique approach 

If you&#39;ve always wanted to be able to pick up a guitar and play a few songs at a party or around the campfire, this is the perfect class for you. The 2-hour workshop focuses on quickly getting you comfortable with playing chords and songs without bogging you down in music theory or learning to read sheet music. Covers:How to tune and hold the pickGetting through the first week Basic left hand techniqueFour fundamental chords that are the foundation of blues, rock and popBasic right hand technique (strumming)Learn 1-2 basic songs and a couple show-off movesLimit 4 people, guitars provided (right-handed only; lefties BYOG)
Instructor Kyle Ingham is the Founder and Managing Director of The Distilled Man. He has been playing guitar for over 20 years and has played in a few local bands.  Prior to starting The Distilled Man, Kyle worked in advertising agencies while daydreaming about grilling, food, wine and mixology.Following a packed house and sweaty-as-Simmons (Richard or Gene, take your pick) dancefloor at its opening, Beats for Lunch (formerly Recess) is back with a second installment and this time we&#39;ve invited MOM to the party!The Motown on Mondays (MOM) DJ&#39;s have fast made a name for themselves, launching their MOM SF weekly party in 2009 and building a fanatic following in just three years. Operating under the tagline, “timeless music, tasteful DJs, forever family”, these purveyors of funk and soul surely have the skills to make twelve o&#39; clock (noon) rock like it was the midnight hour.Beats for Lunch, the new midday dance party brought to you by the merry pranksters at SunsetSF (Sea of Dreams, Silent Frisco, SF Funk Fest), aims squarely at the lethargic routines of round-bellied office workers and delirious dot-commers, prompting them to get ready to get sweaty...during the lunch hour. Beats for Lunch eschews treadmills in favor of tech house and lunch meetings in favor of DJ-dancefloor freedom at new club on the block, Monarch (101 6th St), which boasts the Void sound system recently rated best in the city (SF Weekly; “The Top 10 Best Club Sound Systems in San Francisco”).Beats for Lunch follows the lead of Swedish forebearer, Lunchbeat, which places the urgency of movement and freedom from the workplace as top provisions for its dedicated dancers.The second installment of Beats for Lunch takes place on hump day, Wednesday, August 8th, from 12-2pm. MOM&#39;s PHLECK AND U9LIFT and resident DJ MATT HAZE will provide the beats and VJ All of it Now! will preside over the retinal enhancements.Once again, no cover will be charged and free sandwiches (meat, veggie and vegan options this time - plenty to go around) will be provided so revelers don&#39;t have to forgo nourishment to get their boogie on and make it back to their desks on time.Trelawny Rose takes students on a fast-paced, fun and hands-on journey to their best singing! In this 3-hour workshop, singers learn the basics of vocal technique, how to apply vocal technique to songs, how to make a song one’s own and how to overcome stage fright. Trelawny creates a safe and supportive environment where singers can challenge themselves to become stronger performers.

                 ALL SALES ARE FINAL. Tickets are Non-Refundable and Non-Transferable.=================================================================In this 3-hour workshop, master vocalist Ed Reed guides students through the art of interpreting a lyric. Students sing a song of their choice with a professional accompanist. Topics include pronunciation, breathing, and phrasing as suggested by the nature of the lyric, as well as methods of communicating the story of the lyric to highlight emotion, nuance and irony.
While Ed Reed has been singing since he was a child, he released his first recording at the age of 78 and in the four years since, released two others. Reed’s ability to get inside a lyric has been noted by numerous reviewers. DownBeat wrote in 2011, “When Ed Reed sings…look for an intimate story every time…he establishes a connection to the lyrics and phrasing that is both beautiful and uncanny.” An inspiration on every level, Mr. Reed has been conducting workshops and classes at the Jazzschool over the last four years and has left an impression on all the students he’s come in contact with. Students of all levels are welcome. Maximum enrollment: 10 students.

I&#39;ve had so many people help me or support me along the way, and this launch party is about saying thank you, sharing the book, and clinking a few glasses just to celebrate.

In 1970s America, being aware or &#39;hip&#39; to the political topics at the time was what resulted in sub-culture revolutions in sex, fashion and music. This walking tour aims to educate you on San Francisco&#39;s influence on the movement which, some will argue, began in January 1967 with the Human Be-In in Golden Gate Park. You will learn more about The Beat Generation, organic food, psychedelic rock and the Human Rights movement which evolved in the US and San Francisco. Visit the hot spots including Haight Ashbury and walk in the footsteps of Janis, Jimi and Jefferson...

All tours are approx. 2 hours in length. We go at an easy pace and are happy to accommodate any special requests or detours if suitable. A short break will be made during the tour.

Guide gratuity not included in ticket price.The Gospel of Mary Magdalene: A Deeper Look within the Mysteries of the Enlightened Magdalene

The Gospel of Mary Magdalene reveals truths that impact our thinking and touch our soul in a transformative way.   The Book-study series is a blend of making the sacred, alive in us and exploring the mysteries what the Gospel is trying to say to us in a Jungian contemplative way.  We will explore in this series with the sacred music and sacred ritual, The Gospel of Mary’s teachings on Mary Magdalene’s Enlightened state of mind.  
 
According the translator Joseph Rowe these ancient words when contemplated raise our vibration and open our eyes to a new awakening.  I have personally found this to be true and that is why I offer this contemplative study of the concepts of Her Gospel.  
Each month we move through the text.  We are studying The Gospel of Mary Magdalene as translated by Jean- Yves Leloup (from Egyptian Coptic to French) and Jospeh Rowe who translated it from French into English.
This month series starts on page 9 of the text where we learn about the transformation of Mary that was the demonstration of her “Anthropos” Enlightened state of mind.  This is the most important milestone in Mary’s life.  This is the moment that elevated Mary to a level of Consciousness that previously only the truly great masters on the planet like Jesus, Buddha, and other enlightened masters had achieved.  What is revealed in this section is the real reason she is the Apostle to the Apostle.
The evening will be wrapped in beautiful meditative music and end with a special ritual related to the evening topic to activate the teachings within us. Join us in an evening of deep peace and great joy.Pitch Fridays at Otis Lounge 6-10pm

In the summer of 1984, Paul Johnson taught himself how to spin after watching his cousin Marc spin and scratch in his bedroom. As a self taught artist, Paul&#39;s pulsating energy and passion are apparent in all his work. In high school while his peers were holding down after school jobs, Paul was a popular radio DJ. Raw talent, dedication and a deep love for house music have made Paul Johnson one of the most sought after DJ&#39;s in the world.Paul Johnson&#39;s musical resume is both extensive and impressive; he released his first record in 1990 titled, &#34;Overload&#34; on Dance Mania Records. During this time, Paul quickly made a name for himself as a producer, responsible for many of the now famous DJ/Producers that we all know and love. Paul&#39;s innovative and inspiring production work gained industry recognition as the go to guy. Paul has released over 200 E.P&#39;s himself as well as a vast amount of music for some of the most consistently underground dance labels, all prior to signing with Peacefrog Records. Paul also boasts 12&#34; releases on the likes of Cajual / Relief and Dance Mania which led to his debut album release, &#34;Bump Talkin&#34;, in 1994. &#34;Bump Talkin&#34; and the follow up release, &#34;Feel The Music&#34;, became two of the most talked about releases of their time.In 1998, Paul Johnson released his dance floor killer &#34;Get Get Down&#34; which sold over 3 million copies worldwide. &#34;Get Get Down&#34; was an international mega hit; its smooth melodic beats could be heard in clubs from Chicago to Ibiza, quickly gaining crossover success. Paul achieved record book notoriety, earning him a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records, for the most said word in a song. &#34;Get Get Down&#34; was also licensed on more than 100 CD and house compilations worldwide. Since good music stands the test of time, &#34;Get Get Down&#34; still has an infectious body moving effect on dance floors all over the world. With Paul Johnson you receive electrifying performances and an unwavering commitment to excellence crediting him the respect of both fans and peers alike.Paul Johnson unsurpassed crowd pleasing capabilities have made him one of the best DJ&#39;s to come out of Chicago, packing dance floors all over the planet.

His distinctive rhythmic and soulful sound is what keeps house music fans craving for more. As a seasoned artist, Paul Johnson has released singles which all have made it to many countries top 50 billboard&#39;s and higher. Continuing to do what he was born to do, in February 2010 Paul released &#34;Sound of P.J.&#34; on Mindtravel Recordings Italy and &#34;World Feel It - So Much&#34; on Sonrisa Records Australia. His latest releases are already satisfying his enormous yet growing fan base and are being played in clubs nationwide. &#34;He&#39;s a hit making machine&#34; say&#39;s Yello Records CEO Bob Sinclair and he&#39;s shown so many artists the way.

Winner of a 2009 North Bay Music Award, the Zydeco Flames have issued six CDs of hot zydeco dance music, appeared on Ashkenaz’s 30th Anniversary CD, and shared stages with most of the greats of the style at dances and festivals up and down the West Coast. In 1991 accordion player Bruce Gordon teamed up with singer-rubboard player Lloyd Meadows to play at parties, including the premiere of the essential documentary film on Cajun and zydeco music, “J’ai ete au Bal.” Soon they expanded to a full band – with electric guitarist Frank Bohan, bassist-singer Timm Walker, and drummer William Allums Jr. – carrying on in the tradition of Clifton Chenier, Buckwheat Zydeco, and Queen Ida. The Flames have performed at just about every important event in the Bay Area, from the Black and White Ball to the San Francisco Jazz Festival, as well as countless Louisiana, Cajun, and zydeco fests. Five of their songs are featured in the computer game “The Sims Unleashed.”

Samba Keur Fouta is a refreshing and energizing collaboration of four dynamic musicians with Samba Guisse, a master player of the tama (talking drum), on vocals and drums.
Growing up in Senegal, Guisse was drawn to the drum as a youth. Unlike some other musicians, he was not born into a griot family, and over the disapproval of his parents he studied with elders of the drums. He was a founding member of Kissima Diabate’s Groupe Kiss and has since performed with many acclaimed ensembles such as Gueye Gueye Rhythm and Etoiles Nguewel. Guisse moved to the U.S. in 2003 and has been featured in such local African bands as Djialy Kunda Kouyate and Sila’s Afrofunk Experience. After opening a concert by guitarist Baaba Maal, Guisse was invited to join Maal for the rest of his tour. Guisse also has a solo CD out, recorded during a 10-month trip back to Senegal.

With a background in theater and stand-up comedy, Kellye Gray has developed a technique to help students connect with the creative mind that allows them to improvise, compose and perform on the spot. Singers work with Kellye on various exercises that help to keep the “editor of the mind” in check. In the second half of the workshop, an accompanist joins the class. Interacting with a pianist and with the other students in the workshop, vocalists discover how to create freely and with confidence. The atmosphere of “play” is serious work that translates into results. According to Ms. Gray: “Students learn how to listen, invent, evolve and improvise. They create completely improvised compositions as a solo artist, a duet and even a trio.”
Professionally trained at the Actors Studio, the Comedy Workshop, BA from Southwest Texas State, private studies in technique; Adjunct faculty Austin School of Music, clinician, national and international touring jazz artist, multiple Addy awards, recording artist, producer,
designer, actor, comedienne, artist, composer. Has worked with actors, and comedians, as well as jazz, blues and R&amp;B stars.

A show dedicated to bringing out the best Live Hip Hop performers as well as the top Bass Music producers and DJ&#39;s in the Bay Area and Beyond.Location: Public WorksAugust 15th9:00 PM - 2:00 AM$521+HOPIEhttp://www.hopiespitshard.com/-Hopie Spitshard is not your average rapper. Really. First, she independently released her debut album, The Diamond Dame, in July 2008, immediately garnering national attention and a nomination for URB’s Next 1000. Then, Hopie did a 180 &amp; took a short hiatus to earn her doctorate from U.C. Hastings, emerging only to release 2 music videos &amp; a T-shirt series w/ Adapt Clothing, &amp; to perform at Paid Dues in April 2010. Now, as the ink on her law degree dries, Hopie is again returning to the music scene with an eclectic body of work, her second full-length album, Raw Gems.The pint-sized, tattooed academic has always carved her own, decisively rebellious path. has always carved her own decidedly rebellious path. To distract from realities of her rocky start in Manila, &amp; a difficult, short-lived childhood in San Francisco, Hopie dove headfirst into music. To date, Hopie is self-taught &amp;/or classically trained in violin, voice, music composition, spoken word, drums, &amp; guitar. Still, Hopie&#39;s primary allegiance remains far from the ivory towers of music theory, lying markedly in experimentation with rap. In fact, Hopie’s brand of hip hop is anything but sullen, or conventional._-ENZYME DYNOMITE (Zyme)http://enzymedynamite.com/-Enzyme Dynamite is part of The Bayliens, a new wave cutting edge hip hop group from California. The group consists of Enzyme Dynamite and Spaceman Cell and are backed by DJ True Justice. Known for innovation and electrifying performances that have landed them on the same stages with artists such as Lil Wayne, FloRida, Pitbull, Zion I, Living Legends, Too Short, E-40, NeYo, Sean Kingston, The Pack, Kevin Rudolf, Tech N9ne, Atmosphere, Murs, Slaughterhouse, Danity Kane, and many more.Enzyme Dynamite is currently part of a Target stores and 5 Star Mead school supplies nationwide promotional campaign that has him featured on over 10 million 5 Star Mead products in Target stores nationwide. He has appeared on a variety of television programs that have aired on networks such as MTV Philippines, Kofy TV 20, and The WB, With over 7 west coast tours and a variety of spot performances in other areas such as New York, Germany, Amsterdam, The Philippines, Japan, and Taiwan, Enzyme is no stranger to performance.In 2009 Enzyme Dynamite was voted best new Pop artist at the Hollywood Music in Media Awards held at the HIghlands on Hollywood Blvd. Enzyme Dynamite is the only artist from the Bay Area in recent time to have his music play on 3 Different Top 40 Music Stations including- Wild 94.9 KYLD, LIVE 105.3, and 102.5 KDON all off the same Album-StereoVision&#34;Born in the Dominican Republic, a third world country, Enzyme by the age of 5 years old had experienced an armed robbery and an attempted kidnapping which he escaped from. These dangerous events led to his parents moving him to Minnesota. Again he was faced with another traumatic experience when his father was arrested at gun point for sales of cocaine. Enzyme&#39;s mother moved him and his sister to Hawaii and then to California where Enzyme would find hip hop. He started building a buzz by throwing his own shows and selling cd&#39;s all over the streets until fate led him to meeting the members of his group and forming The Bayliens.Enzyme Dynamite and The Bayliens are among the new wave of artists that are being craved by music listeners and fans worldwide.
_-JOHNNY 5 (Ritual Dubstep SF/ Irie Cartel)-If you reside in Northern California and frequent dubstep/bass music events, you almost certainly recognize the face behind the layers of wobbling bass, crunchy drums, and hypnotic melodies. An Oakland, CA resident, by way of Chicago, Johnny5 cut his teeth as an MC and hip-hop producer in both cities, sharing stages with the likes of independent legends Typical Cats as well as major acts including Raekwon and Devin the Dude.Upon moving to Oakland in 2005, Johnny5 began to take in the diverse, quickly evolving sounds pulsating throughout the Northern California music scene. Already having an extensive background in hip-hop, reggae, and electronic music, it was only natural that Johnny would embrace the dubstep genre and begin to cultivate his own sound, taking elements from each of these musical cultures. After a series of mixes that remained vastly unheard, the world began to take notice after his first official release, &#34;Johnny 5 Alive.&#34;In May of 2010 he co-founded San Francisco&#39;s most popular dubstep weekly, &#34;Ritual Dubstep,&#34; every Thursday starting at Anu bar and now residing in the catacombs at Temple night club. This event unexpectedly blossomed from a small, intimate party, featuring mainly locals, into a massive nightclub production each week - but still true to the gritty and grimy sounds that made the party what it is. Ritual has been honored to host international dubstep stars such as Truth (New Zealand), Ajapai (Japan), and Wedge (UK), as well as Bay Area legends including Antiserum, Matty G, and DJG.Besides handling booking, promotion, and organization for Ritual, Johnny5 has kept busy by doing two Northwest tours (with Bay Area heavyweights Megalodon and Los Angeles DJ/producer Bodie), releasing several mixes (available at www.soundcloud.com/johnny5dubstep), and polishing up his production, both as a solo artist and as a member of the duo Splatterface (alongside Chris &#34;Audiobomb&#34; Rice).With an arsenal of forthcoming original tunes, a vast collection of rare and exclusive tracks, and uncanny ability to read a crowd&#39;s mood, Johnny5 continues to spread his unique blend of filthy bass music styles to dance floors and festivals around the West Coast and worldwide!-TASO-In 2012, it is a rare thing for a young person to emulate such soul, but at 24 it feels like Taso has been around since much longer than having just coming to consciousness in the neon reflective, high-fade, gloss and glitter cradle of the 90’s in America.However, born in Massachusetts in 1988 and transplanted in California at 14, Taso and his music have a hypnotic joviality and exuberance that feel eerily beyond his years. There is jazz buried between the crevasses of his music, and his work resounds with a feeling of distinct street beat crossed with the substance of technical virtuosity. Birth name, Anastasios Ioannis Skalkos, young master Taso has spent the greater portion of his life crafting a musical identity from his unearthly passion for big bass and bringing people together to have a good time.His earliest musical influences are groups like The Wu and Biggie, but Taso also champions pioneers like Jimi Hendrix and King Tubby, as well as his affinity for old school hip hop and late 90s grind core. Much like the fortuitously eclectic decade that influenced his young brain, Taso’s music has a bit of all of these elements present in his musical soundscape. At times, his beats are trunk-busting, slow rhyme inducing, pop-and-lock, deep, West Cost breaks that have an element of dubstep.In a flash, Taso’s use of synths proves as razor sharp as any contender in the big bass alleyway of top ten lists across the EDM globe. With a college degree in audio, Skalkos is a veritable grenade of bass, highly enabled to manipulate patches from soothing and lullaby-like to chest-bursting, disemboweling, distorted, monster tones ready to claw your eyes out. In that way that you want. Badly. And know it.

the Generations party is a new monthly dance party that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. Generations encompasses music from every decade with each DJ being the ambassador for the soundscape of that time. 
 
The dance party will feature some of the premier DJs in the Bay and across the US. Inspired by the idea that “within parameters spawns creativity”, each DJ chooses a decade to play music. Within this decade’s music, the DJ has a chance to cross genres, play tributes, and expose their fans to a side of their taste of expertise or experimentation. 
 
the Generations party is a monthly outlet to bring together a dance community where the listener/DJ interaction is brought to a new level conceptually and culturally. Your host DJ Franchise and the great staff at SOM offer fans of Bay Area nightlife an alternative in the dancing experience.Holy Ground Christian Center  Invites you to its  2ND ANNUAL GOSPEL @ THE GATEWAY CONCERT

- UPSCALE ATTIRE PREFERREDRock and Stroll....Subtle Listening is a mode of listening where one&#39;s imagination is open to the sound world around them, helping their inner ear and outer world intersect. The Subtle Listening workshop is an ongoing workshop for musicians, media artists, filmmakers, composers, producers, sound designers, or any type of artist who wants to sharpen their listening skills. The workshop uses a wide range of techniques culled from Jungian psychology, Hermetic philosophy, paradox and Buddhist mediation, as well as thirty years of my own experience as a sound artist and electro-acoustic music composer. Through guided meditation, and various types of listening exercises, participants will learn techniques they can use any time to help heighten their sensitivity to the sounds around them.
As a courtesy to the workshop participants it would be appreciated if everyone arrived at the studio at 11AM sharp.

Lynn Ruth Miller is coming to Redwood City to share the original songs and outrageous comedy that made her an international cabaret comedian with surprise burlesque performers.  She hit the headlines in EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND , when she jumped out of a cake (almost) and removed her clothes (not quite) in front of the castle.  Now she is a legend who wraps eager fans in spandex to prove that AGING IS AMAZING  with her off-key cabaret show glorifying old age and reveling in the disasters it brings to the human form and the feminine mystique. 
 
 This is musical comedy at its worst proving that even though your body parts drop to your ankles, they still can move with enough zest raise an eyebrow if nothing else 

2 drink minimum or dinner with ticket.  
Dinner reservations: www.angelicasbistro.com/reservations.htm
 
WHAT THEY ARE SAYING: 
Lynn Ruth Miller is a true original, a unique and vivacious artist - writer, raconteur, singer, burlesque performer, satirist and comic.  She is inspiration to younger and less energetic artists like me.
Mark Mc Innes, Edinburgh 
 
With the modesty of youth gone, she grapples life’s dilemmas head on, and with a song. Based on her own colorful experiences, her audience are taught self help cures for impotence, incontinence, and how to enjoy old age. Musical Theater Matters
 This is an ages 18+ show
 

 
Top Shelf&#39;s &#34;Touch of VEGAS&#34;  Dinner Show brings you the best of Las Vegas all in one show. Experience a delicious buffet dinner, the International Champion Magician, &#39;Chin-Chin&#39;, San Francisco&#39;s 3-time &#39;Stage Magician of the Year&#34;, Comedy with Dennis Gaxiola, and Top Shelf&#39;s  musical journey from Vegas&#39; hottest hits to sounds of today. With non-stop excitement and beautiful showgirls, &#39;A touch of VEGAS&#39; is a must see.

 
 Fast Times is back at Maggie McGarry&#39;s in North Beach. Show starts at 10 pm (it’s free!), and if you’ve seen us at Maggie’s before, you know you’ll want to arrive early to secure your spot on the dance floor before it’s over-run with 80s clad partiers.

Fast Times is available for Public and Private Events. Other Minds proudly presents a one-day film festival in celebration of the 100th birthday of maverick composer/artist/essayist John Cage. Taking over the Roxie Cinema on Saturday, September 22, &#34;John Cage &amp; Friends&#34; features wildly entertaining and rare archival footage of the iconoclastic master and his pioneering collaborators -- including choreographer Merce Cunningham, artist Robert Rauschenberg, and musician/tech guru David Tudor. It&#39;s nothing less than a mind-blowing overview of radical art practice.Hailed as &#34;an inventor of genius,&#34; Cage infamously explored new possibilities for the construction and performance of music, including the &#39;prepared piano,&#39; use of everyday objects and chance operations in composition, and a recognition of silence. His investigations and achievements were paralleled by his longtime partner and collaborator Merce Cunningham, and friends Robert Rauschenberg and David Tudor. These historic films provide an invaluable touchpoint for artists, composers, and performers today.
The Other Minds Film Festival gives audiences a first-hand experience of Cage and Cunningham performing and discussing their work - a central influence on twenty-first century art. Curated by filmmaker Peter Esmonde (Trimpin: The Sound of Invention).The VIP Festival Pass includes -

Priority seating and tickets to all four screenings (2:00, 4:00, 7:30, and 9:30 P.M.)

Droid presents PRIME w/ Tony Rohr + Android Cartel
10pm - 2am :: $7  - $15 :: 21+INFO: 323.213.9736MEDUSA LOUNGE3211 Beverly BlvdLos Angeles, CA 90057

music by:Tony Rohr - Clink :: Plus 8 :: Weave :: Droid // NY
At this point it is difficult for us to sum up the multi-faceted career and personality of Tony Rohr. He is Brooklyn&#39;s bang mixed with Mid-Western politeness, and is easily one of the most original and well-liked artists in the industry. His sought-after Live PA, matched with a discography and release schedule that aspiring artists would kill for, keeps him consistently in high demand. He has turned up the heat in recent years, burning miles across the globe and sharing his enthusiasm for music and life via Macbook, Machinedrum and two Korg&#39;s. Tony&#39;s lengthy journey from a College scratch DJ in Effingham, IL, to Brooklyn live artist and International superstar has been driven by his love and fascination for innovative musical ideas. His range of inspiration fuels his indefinable sound, gathering ideas through early Hip-Hop, House, Industrial and finally Techno. Channeling these expressions through his performances has earned him center stage at places like I Love Techno, Nature One, Awakenings, Tresor, Berghain, Chris Liebing&#39;s Spinclub, Kozzmozz, Fuse, and even the closing of the famous La Real in Spain. In 2005 Tony met Tim Xavier and Camea in Brooklyn, and they began releasing together on Clink Recordings. He has contributed to five of their releases as a solo artist, and collaboratively with Tim as the Afternoon Coffee Boys. He ignited the label&#39;s popularity with his biggest record of 2007, Kreuzberg Krunk. Tony also works with Alexi Delano, Dietrich Schoenemann and Dave Shokh (Dirka Dirka) on numerous projects and his work has been featured on top labels such as Cocoon, Weave, Plus 8, Drumcode, Podium and Frankie Records.

 Yamaha Music School Students from Canada, Costa Rica, Mexico &amp; the United States Perform Their Original Compositions
 
About the Concert

For this year’s U.S. National JOC, nine U.S. students will be joined by fellow young ambassadors of music from Yamaha Music Schools in Canada, Costa Rica and Mexico. Ranging from 8-16 years, these children will amaze you with their mature compositional and performance talents.

                                                                                                                                                     the Wing House  What we all need is inner peace...and people who listen....
You&#39;re invited to learn about Teen Talking Circles at an intimate concert with Deva Premal &amp; Miten, and support young people and adults in your community to create sustainable, thriving relationships with themselves and others through circles and Compassionate Listening.
Teen Talking Circles save lives. TTC has offered after-school programs since 1993. Teens love circle. They thrive in circle. How do we know this? Because they come back week after week, 9 months per year and tell us so. At the benefit, you&#39;ll have an opportunity to meet teens who have participated in circle, and hear directly from them why they feel so deeply connected, and experience why Teen Talking Circles has attracted so many adults to begin circles in their communities around the world.
Deva Premal and Miten are global treasures. Deva&#39;s voice and the ancient mantras she chants have brought tremendous love, peace and inspiration to people the world over. Her beautiful and soulful rendering of timeless spiritual prayers draw people into a sense of oneness and felt connection. Accompanied by her husband, Miten,  Naepalese flute maestro, Manose, and keyboardist, Maneesh de Moor, together they bless and inspire audiences wherever they perform --whether on the floor in a hotel room with members of the Girl&#39;s Talking Circle, or a private audience with the Dalai Lama, or in front of hundreds or thousands of adoring fans around the world.  Says Miten, &#34;The true purpose of our music is to awaken a longing in the heart for that which is omnipresent: the experience of silence and meditation. It&#39;s not about entertainment - it is simply our spiritual practice.&#34;

The Wing House is a phenomenal location for our concert. Overlooking the Malibu mountains, and the ocean below, the garden will be filled with *Persian rugs and comfy chairs to sit or lay on while listening to the concert. Our hostess, Francie Rehwald, conceived the idea of building her house from a recycled 747, saying she wanted a house that was environmentally friendly and feminine. Her dream manifested when her architect, David Hertz, suggested she go ahead and purchase a recycled 747. Her 80 acre property had previously belonged to acclaimed artist/designer, Tony Duquette. His enclave was scattered with amazing pagodas and pavilliaons, most of which were destroyed in the 1993 Malibu fire. Everything lay in ruin until Francie purchased the property. She not only created her own masterpiece of a house, but rebirthed the land by planting thousands of flowers, plants, vines and trees, and importing containers of art from India and Indonesia, rebuilding the pagodas, and creating an architectural wonder, The Wing House. * Donated generously by Tasdemir Rugs on Bainbridge Island 
                                 OPTIONS FOR ATTENDING THE BENEFIT INCLUDE: 

2:30 - 3:30pm:  Pre-concert tour of the Wing House and gardens with architect, David Hertz, and owner, Francie Rehwald, plus concert ($85 per ticket is tax deductible)
4:00 - 6:30: Concert
6:30 - 8:30pm: Tour, concert, and after-party with special guests, including actress, Lindsay Wagner, and more.  ($210 per ticket is tax deductible)

For those who sign up for the tour prior to the concert, David Hertz, architect of the Wing House and Francie Rehwald, owner, will walk and talk you through the history of the property, made famous by Tony Duquette, and also the process of designing and building the main house, gardens, pagodas, and property. You&#39;ll see what remains from the fire that destroyed Tony Duquette&#39;s creative home, and also the many extraordinary pieces of art Francie has imported from around the world.
The intimate after-party will be hosted by special guests, including actress Lindsay Wagner. Delicious hors d&#39;oeuvres will be served. Spaces for the tour and after-party are limited. (All fees above the basic concert ticket price are tax deductible.) 
During the concert, there will be an opportunity to learn more about Teen Talking Circles, purchase CDs, and enjoy light refreshments. If you can&#39;t attend, please contribute by making a donation for a local teen or youth provider to attend. 
The benefit will be magical, not only for the beautiful people performing and the extraordinary location, but for each of you attending. We are creating an event filled with generosity. It will be zero-waste, no plastic, alcohol-free, organic, and youth friendly. We will all be part of creating the energy, spirit, and love that will make it a an experience we will always remember.

&#34;Our impulse to help others and ourselves, especially the young ones, to heal and grow is real and powerful. Our job is to facilitate and role model what it means to be authentically human, and identify the gifts inherent in every experience, especially what hurts. Practicing Compassionate Listening, taking radical responsibility, telling the truth, and being connected in sacred circle is a way.&#34; Linda Wolf

INCOGNITO @ King King Hollywood Celebrating 6 Years of Amazing Cutting-Edge House &amp; Techno Friday 31st August 2012 || A Labor Day Weekend TraditionJAMES HOLDENBorder Community, UKwww.jamesholden.org---------------------------------------------------------Two words - &#34;JAMES HOLDEN.&#34; After throwing 330+ events, INCOGNITO celebrates its 6th Year Anniversary by returning to our home venue for 5 Year straight, &amp; with the DJ that has defined what amazing cutting edge House &amp; Techno really means - James Holden.  What others say about the British Techno Sorcerer &amp; Psychedelic Label Boss of Border Community:  &#34;JAMES HOLDEN IS the music&#34; - Sasha &#34;A MODERN GENIUS&#34; - Gabriel &amp; Dresden  &#34;MAGIC&#34; - Marcus Schossow &#34;I MAKE MUSIC THAT I THINK JAMES HOLDEN WILL WANT TO PLAY, HE IS THE MOST UNIQUE GUY IN EDM&#34; - Four Tet  British techno sorcerer and psychedelic shaman james holden is a man of many talents: zeitgeist-defining label boss, trend-setting producer, hugely in-demand monster remixer, and last but by no means least, he can count himself amongst that very modern breed of disc jockey with a special knack for layering seemingly divergent records with an unparalleled musical ear. Founded in 2003 as a restriction-free outlet for his own music and launch pad for the production careers of his band of talented friends, james holden&#39;s Border Community label is now firmly established as one of the foremost breeding grounds for fresh young electronic talent, thanks to their small but faithful army of free-spirited genre benders who between them have injected a new life into the European scene.  In a james holden DJ set this tireless dedication to hunting down the next wave of young production talent is brazenly united with tracks from music&#39;s past and present, disregarding genre, confounding the purists and making club hits out of many an unwitting dancefloor virgin. The rather fanatical cult of Border Community which has sprung up around james holden&#39;s own label has proved essential in achiveving his independence from the narrow limitations of genre-specific music, and so distinct is his resultant sound that your average conservative dance music night can barely contain it, which is why james holden is often best experienced alongside his edgy labelmates at one of the many Border Community label nights the world over.  james holden&#39;s status as an exemplary DJ free-spirit unconstrained by genre or scene was recently confirmed by stalwart indie label !K7, who last year called upon him to deliver his own installment for their definitive mix album series DJ Kicks, along with the first solo Holden single in four years. The primal, rhythmic glory of james holden&#39;s latest mix CD missive is a musical manifesto that seems particuarly well-timed, and the assembled gathering of musical drifters from across the globe represents his personal recommendation of where the scene might best be driven next.We expect to HIT CAPACITY early this night, so buy your Limited Discount Tickets NOW before they run out and ensure entry for this amazing party. This is a SPECIAL EVENT &amp; tickets at the door will sell @ $20 til 11p, $25 til midnight w/ RSVP. Don&#39;t hesitate and get your pre-sale tickets now.

Live @ Sunset Marquis Presents
Rachel McGoye, Kate Miller-Heidke, 
and Chelsea Williams
 
Live @ Sunset Marquis, an acoustic music series featuring emerging artists in today&#39;s music scene, is an outstanding showcase featuring 2 - 3 artists each show performing superb music across multiple genres. The atmosphere is alive and the venue a refreshing departure from the typical ones in the area. You&#39;re sure to enjoy yourself and with appetizer and drink specials, and be sure to bring along your significant other for a unique evening of entertainment.  And with Sunset Marquis&#39; ties to the music industry, you never know just who might pop in for a listen or even an impromptu gig.
All showcases take place on our Villa Pool deck. Gates open at 6:30pm. Music begins at 7:00pm and continues until 10:00pm. 
A limited quantity of tickets will be available per show. Tickets are $20 each, $10 for hotel guests, and that includes all fees. Information on event dates throughout the summer and artist lineups can be found at www.liveatsunsetmarquis.com. Parking is limited so best to look to garages in the area at the top of Alta Loma and take the short walk to the hotel. 
A silent auction will be held each week for an ESP Guitar as well, benefiting the Traveling Guitar Foundation, an excellent charity focused on providing the resources necessary for our schools to continue music enrichment programs for our kids.  
Hope to see you there! 
 Drop in all throughout the day to see every plugin currently available for AAX and AAX Native!  Talk directly with developers to learn how their unique plugins can play an important role in your workflow and benefit your production.  Bring your own sessions, because we&#39;ll also have HD Native and HDX systems set up to test drive (call to schedule an appointment)!
At 7:30pm, a speaker from Avid will bring us up to date on the latest developments in the Pro Tools world, and present a &#34;where are we now?&#34; look at the new systems.

WORKSHOP + CONCERT INFO: 
The Nada Yoga Temple of Sound Workshop is a profoundly transformative an deeply inspiring workshop based on the ancient Tantric practice of Bhuta Shuddi ~ the purification and refinement of the chakras (or energy centers of the body) and the elements that relate to them through the vehicle of sound. This is a dynamic yogic practice that heals the body and awakens the Kundalini Shakti in the Sacred Body Temple. 
 
Bij (or seed) mantras are used as well as other specific devotional chants to the deities ruling the domain of each corresponding chakra. Guided visualization meditations are also used in correlation with these bij mantras and chants to enliven and clarify the specific energies that employ the workings of each chakra. 

BIO + INFO:http://www.bhagavandas.com/Bhagavan Das is one of the last living cultural icons of the 1960&#39;s. as Ram Das&#39;s mentor (author of Be Here Now) he ushered in the New Age Spiritual Movement being the first Kirtan Artist in America. His groundbreaking album &#34;Ah&#34; (1971) produced by Jimmi Hendrix&#39;s manager Michael Jeffrey&#39;s was the first World Music album from Electric Ladyland. Bhagavan Das has also toured with Allen Ginsberg, opened for the Grateful Dead and sang with Bob Dylan.living as a sadhu in India for six years, Bhagavan Das studied the ancient science of Nada Yoga under the guidance and direction of his Guru Neem Karoli Baba. Nada Yoga is the path of devotion to the inner sound current as a means to God Realization. in the Rolling Stone review of the album &#34;Ah&#34;, Alan Watts said, &#34;Bhagavan Das is truly a Master of Nada Yoga!&#34;
&#34;Beastie Boy Mike D&#39;s yoga guru makes some funky chants. Others have mixed chillout and Indian Music but Now goes deeper than most . . . . It&#39;s a serene spiritual album that also manages to belong to this time and space.&#34;  - ROLLING STONE

After a star reaches a certain point, it&#39;s easy to forget what they became famous for and concentrate solely on their persona. Madonna is such a star. Madonna rocketed to stardom so quickly in 1984 that it obscured most of her musical virtues. Appreciating her music became even more difficult as the decade wore on, as discussing her lifestyle became more common than discussing her music. However, one of Madonna&#39;s greatest achievements is how she manipulated the media and the public with her music, her videos, her publicity, and her sexuality. Arguably, Madonna was the first female pop star to have complete control of her music and image.

Pop singer Justin Bieber was barely into his teens when he released his platinum-selling debut, My World, and became one of 2009&#39;s youngest success stories. An Ontario native, Bieber had placed second in a local singing competition two years prior and began posting his performances on YouTube. The videos caught the attention of Scooter Braun, a talent agent and former So So Def marketing executive, who helped Bieber land an impromptu audition with the R&amp;B star Usher. Impressed by what he saw, Usher -- along with Island/Def Jam chairman L.A. Reid -- quickly signed the 15-year-old Bieber to a recording contract.
Bieber released his first single, &#34;One Time,&#34; in May 2009. Supported by a popular video that featured an appearance by Usher, &#34;One Time&#34; went platinum in both Canada and America, a feat that was replicated later that year with the release of My World. The disc was technically an EP, featuring only seven songs, but it reached number six on the Billboard 200 album chart and sold over a million copies. Less than a year after his debut, Bieber returned with the &#34;second half&#34; of My World, a ten-song release titled My World 2.0. Further demonstrating his and his management&#39;s marketing power, over 8,000 fans who pre-ordered My World 2.0 had their head shots used in a photo mosaic (formed to look like a portrait of Bieber) that was displayed on the back side of the disc&#39;s booklet. The release topped the Billboard 200. A few weeks later, a combination of My World and My World 2.0, titled My Worlds, appeared in some territories.
By the end of 2010, Bieber issued My Worlds Acoustic, a set featuring acoustic versions of nine songs off the My World discs, as well as one new song. The following February, the 3-D documentary Never Say Never was released to theaters. The seven-track Never Say Never: The Remixes, released just days after the film, maintained the flow of Bieber product, and featured appearances from the likes of Kanye West, Usher, and Miley Cyrus. Just in time for Christmas 2011 came the holiday-themed Under the Mistletoe, complete with several celebrity guest duets and an original song, &#34;Mistletoe,&#34; for the first single, which entered the Holiday Songs chart at number two.

Hey!

So you want to learn how to build your music career online, but not sure how to start. The music industry is changing on the daily, and it’s hard to keep up with the trends, the tools, and how to get those fans on your own.

It’s not just about recording a song, vying to get signed by a record label, or touring anymore. Musicians need to be multi-talented, business-minded, digital savvy individuals that can juggle an ever-increasing number of social media properties. You need to be a jack and jill of all trades!

Come and mix with influential music industry members of New York. Hosted by Tunezy.com, a Music Experience Marketplace, we’re bringing together only the most innovative crowd in music, media, and financing. 

The first drink is on us!

 


Hosts / Guests:
Cheryl B. Engelhardt is a composer for films, ads and CollegeHumor.com, and a singer/songwriter who’s booked a bunch of tours around the USA and Europe and gotten her recorded music placed on lots of TV shows. Her website is www.CBEmusic.com and she writes a music industry blog called Living On Gigging. You can follow her on Twitter @CBE.

Derrick Fung is the CEO of Tunezy - a new startup focused on independent and emerging musicians.  Prior to Tunezy, Derrick worked in the Investment Banking industry and also spent time working at the Clinton Foundation in New York City. Tunezy has been featured in various outlets including Bloomberg, Yahoo! Music, BetaKit and Reuters.

Education in Ghana is free through Junior High School.  However, in order to attend high school, there is a tuition fee of $500.00.  The people in these villages are small farmers and day traders who earn no more than $2.00 per day. They can&#39;t afford to send their children to high school.
By providing scholarships we are offering children an opportunity for a brighter future based upon self-sufficiency, independence and self-esteem.

A Lasting Impression is a new musical that combines music, theatre and visual art. The story, three versions of the same narrative, is told by its three leads, Josh and sisters Kali and Simone Blanche, each through his or her own artistic medium. Josh, a once guarded journalist, acts as its narrator, using old taped interviews and pictures to guide us through his memory of the two sisters. Kali, a manic musician, is the piece’s composer, moving in and out of “her band” as the story unfolds. Simone, a young painter, controls the evolution of what begins as a blank set, and comes to life through the addition of her visual art. A Lasting Impression is about impressions that we make through love, on those close to us, and through art, on those we may never meet.
Beame &amp; Mencher LLP Presents:
THIS IS A FREE EVENT. SEATS ARE LIMITED. PLEASE REGISTER TO ATTEND. IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO MAKE IT, PLEASE LET US KNOW SO THAT SOMEONE ELSE CAN RESERVE YOUR SEAT.
The Musician&#39;s Legal Toolbox
- a three-part series on the business of music, copyright, and trademark basics for musicians -

Please join Beame &amp; Mencher LLP at their Manhattan office for their newest law seminar: The Musician&#39;s Legal Toolbox — a three-verse seminar exploring the business of music, copyright, and trademark basics. This seminar is designed for solo musicians as well as musical groups, and it addresses key issues and considerations that may arise at any point in a musician’s career. Registration is free, but space is limited!
 
Verse I: Role Play—Manager and Producer Agreements
You&#39;re Captain: Pick the Team.
In Verse I, we&#39;ll introduce you to members of any successful musician&#39;s team, and then delve into the material terms of a manager and producer agreement. These are usually two of the first members on your team - knowing the terms of those contracts is crucial to ensuring you protect your interests for the long term. 

Verse II: Know Your Rights—Music Copyright Basics 
Don’t’ Fret. Be in Tune with the Law.
In this part, we will learn about the role copyright law plays in a songwriter’s career and discuss ways of earning money from songwriting (and how to obtain a copyright). We will also explore songwriter collaboration—common oversights made during the process and the importance of a songwriter agreement.
 
* What is a copyright and how do I get one? * How do I make a living from my songs? * What should I know about collaboration before I embark on one?
 
Verse III: Putting the ® in Band—Trademark and Branding Basics 
Become a Noted Success.
The last part of the seminar will focus on trademark and branding essentials and the importance of a trademark for a band or musician. We will discuss trademark basics for musicians, such as selecting and clearing trademarks, trademarks rights and ownership, licensing basics, right of publicity, costs, and developing a trademark strategy.
 
* What is a trademark and do I need one?
* What do I have to do to get one?
* How much is this gonna cost me?   - – - – - – - – - – - – - – 

The “Musician&#39;s Legal Toolbox”  is presented at the offices of Beame &amp; Mencher LLP: 251 W. 30th St. #10FE in New York City. It will begin promptly at 6:30 pm on August 6, 2012. For more information, visit us at www.bmlawgroup.com.

Jordan Roche, aka Barron, the Dubstep badman from Bel Air, Maryland has been smashing faces with his spine tingling basslines since before even graduating high school! With releases on numerous labels, Barron has bombarded the scene with his brutal, unrelenting sound. With support from artists such as DATSIK, Barron is no doubt one of the lead producers in pushing the sound of Dubstep to be as heavy and brutal as possible. Only eighteen years old and “Barron is one of the biggest and baddest names in the game” already. A prodigy of sorts, one would expect nothing but a bright future for this strapping young lad.

There’s a Phantom in My Opera
 
A Comedy and Music Show
 
Written and Performed by Elizabeth Tryon

 
 
 
Finalist in WQXR radio’s international comedy-and-music competition
 
As seen on PBS &amp; NBC television
 
In this hilarious concert, steeped in vocal virtuosity and classic musical numbers, beautiful singer Elizabeth Tryon channels the likes of Victor Borge to create an unforgettable, audience-friendly event. 
 
Audience members will find themselves swept up in the hilarity and the beautiful music as Elizabeth brings a modern touch to lampooning every aspect of a concert singer’s performance, from texting while singing, disputes with her accompanist, singing as a sport, fear of the Phantom of the Concert Hall, and much more… (concert description continues below)
 
“Tryon displays considerable vocal talent” Newsday
 
“…reminiscent of the great Anna Russell” Musical America
 
“Obvious talent” Robert Klein, comedian
 
“Brava!” Deborah Voigt, Metropolitan Opera singer
 
“In my almost 30 years of booking concerts here I’ve never heard the audience have such a strong response to a performer” Bill Camal, concert booker, Fort Lee, NJ
 
“Tryon is a rare performer who has both pop and classical chops, beauty and a great sense of comedy.&#34; Elliott Forrest, WQXR radio
 
Elizabeth performs classical repertoire by Puccini, Mozart, Handel, Massenet, Donizetti, Chausson, and Bellini, classic Broadway songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Irving Berlin, catchy Celtic and contemporary songs, and more.
 
Elizabeth’s vocal virtuosity is sure to delight classical music fans as well as concert newcomers. 
 
Beautiful singing meets comedy in this professionally directed show!

Rising out of the low country of Savannah, GA in 2001, Perpetual Groove has grown quickly into a formidable international touring organization. Now based in Athens, GA, the band continues to ride an unending wave of momentum buoyed by an enthusiastic fan base and international critical acclaim. Fans of Perpetual Groove (or PGroove, as the fans like to call them) are known to follow the band from state to state, night to night, to experience their euphoric live show that features an ever changing set-list. Perpetual Groove&#39;s music has evolved into a genre-bending, highly original sound that touches upon jazz-rock, neo-psychedelia, R&amp;B, trance electronica, progressive rock, and anthemic arena rock. Their large catalog of original music offers something for everyone, but the band is also known for their eclectic range of covers; including everything from Michael Jackson&#39;s Thriller to Rage Against The Machine&#39;s Bulls On Parade. The addition of an intense, retina burning, intelligent light show creates an atmosphere unlike any other, assuring fans they&#39;ll get a highly polished, yet different show each night.
Perpetual Groove released their first album, Sweet Oblivious Antidote, in 2003 on Harmonized Records after their first year of solid touring. Besides being the top seller for The Home Grown Music Network that year (it out-sold releases by Phish, Widespread Panic, and others), it was also voted HGMN Top Fan Pick for 2003. The buzz only got bigger on the 2004 follow-up record, All This Everything, which was produced by Grammy award-winner Robert Hannon. LiveLoveDie, their third record was released in March of 2007 and represents a significant evolutionary departure in style for Perpetual Groove. Teaming up once again with Hannon and Tree Sound Studios, the band set forth to create a darker sonic landscape without sacrificing too much of that PGroove quality thanks in part to Butler&#39;s warm, soaring vocals. HEAL, released in 2010, firmly established Perpetual Groove as more than a jamband with its focus on well-crafted songs. Honey Cuts, an EP, was released in late 2010 featuring three songs that did not fit in with the theme of Heal.
Matthew McDonald, keyboardist from 2001-2008, rejoined the band on 12/31/11 and will now complete the original PGroove sound.
Perpetual Groove continues to tour relentlessly throughout the United States and is a staple in the US festival scene with performances at All Good Music Festival, Gathering of the Vibes, Wakarusa, Bonnaroo, Jam Cruise, High Sierra, Jazz Fest, Riverbend and their own annual gathering, Amberland. The band has also made appearances at International events such as Jam in the Dam and Caribbean Holidaze. Perpetual Groove continues to push the envelope in the music industry, touring behind the first ever 5.1 surround sound system and producing the first album to be completely offset by renewable energy credits.
 
Check out our newly refurbished Classic Album Sundays website for news on events and recommended listening, viewing and reading.
Join us at 5 pm for the musical lead-up which will include selections from other psychedelic and soul acts from the 1960&#39;s. Ron Like Hell will then relay the story behind the album including why Love never made it as big as their Elektra label-mates The Doors yet how frontman Arthur Lee inspired many acts from Sly Stone to Jimi Hendrix.At 7 pm, the lights go down, the volume goes up and we play the album from beginning to end on vinyl on our audiophile hi-fi. The audio menu will include a Rega Apheta MC Cartridge, a Rega P9 Turntable, a Moon 310 LP Phono Preamp, a Moon P7 Line Preamp, Cardas balanced cabling, a Mark Levinson No. 334 Power Amp and 4 Klipschorns. Bellwether also have a great raw bar - we suggest the oysters!Doors close at 6:45 or when we reach full capacity but we suggest you get there as early as possible to enjoy the entire experience. Listening guidelines apply.Twilight Gospel Jazz

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls and children of all ages
(over 21 of course)...I&#39;d like to invite you to spend Saturday August 11th at the House of Yes for a program of dance music. Bringing together some of the hardest working underground DJs in House music here on the East Coast, Good Times is the beginning of a series of events focusing on the basics. Cheap drinks, good local talent and as many trimmings as we can afford while still making sure everyone is compensated for their work. While we&#39;re focusing on House for the first event, we&#39;ll be trying to bring you the best in Drum &amp; Bass, Techno, Electro, Neo-Swing, Hobotech and whatever else you guys would want to listen to. Our DJs will take us on a journey through 6 different sub-genres and interpretations of House music, from East Coast &amp; disco through Miami &amp; Progressive, and into Deep &amp; Tech later in the evening. Come on by, dance, chill, even argue with people about the definition of &#34;Tech House&#34; with other movement-minded New Yorkers. $10 in advance, and $15 at the door, because we&#39;re not trying to break anyone&#39;s bank.We&#39;d love to slowly create a home for people looking to check out not only new DJs but old DJs taking risks in new directions. We&#39;ve all been to parties with $15 martinis, costume requirements or the always troublesome &#34;too many bros.&#34; We&#39;re hoping, with your help, to have an evening of sweet music, old friends, new faces and a safe space. In other words, Good Times.

Martha Wash is a music legend, spanning genres from pop and dance to R&amp;B, and is responsible for some of the most celebrated music to ever hit the airwaves. With a career lasting more than three decades and including two Grammy nominations, she is no stranger to No. 1 hits, as the voice behind tracks like &#34;It&#39;s Raining Men,&#34; &#34;Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now),&#34; and &#34;Carry On.&#34; Wash has truly done it all. She has performed for President and Mrs. Clinton at the White House and has appeared at international venues such as Carnegie Hall, The Kennedy Center, Moscow&#39;s Red Square, and many more. She&#39;s received the Keys to the City of Miami Beach , and both Washington, D.C., and San Francisco have declared Martha Wash Day in her honor.
Wash scored her first hit in the &#39;80s with The Weather Girls (the former backup singers for soul singer Sylvester). &#34;It&#39;s Raining Men&#34; became a worldwide phenomenon, peaking at No. 2 on the U.K. Singles chart and No. 1 on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart. The track continues to receive regular play in clubs and on dance radio stations to this day. After The Weather Girls disbanded, Wash continued to contribute her talents to various house and dance tracks, including singing lead vocals on the C+C Music Factory&#39;s smash hit &#34;Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)&#34; (although she was never formally credited). Wash has also released two solo albums, Martha Wash (1993) and The Collection (1998). The first of these albums featured the third smash hit of Wash&#39;s career, &#34;Carry On.&#34;
In the years since Wash first made her indelible mark on the industry, she&#39;s continued to release some of her most captivating music, perform worldwide, and work to call attention to causes closest to her heart, including autism and HIV and AIDS prevention. In 2004, she also started her own music label, Purple Rose Records, releasing the soulful and dance inspired tune &#34;You Lift Me Up,&#34; which shot to Top 5 on the Billboard Dance Chart. In recent years, she has lent her talents to Jim Papoulis in his project Sounds of a Better World, Small Voices Calling, as well as to DJ Tony Moran, whose 2007 hit &#34;Keep Your Body Working&#34; featured Wash and reached No. 1 on the Billboard Dance chart. In 2011, she released a new single, &#34;I&#39;ve Got You,&#34; a breathtaking blend of pop and R&amp;B that will engage and delight old fans and new crowds alike.The New Jersey-based Bell Bottom Blues is an dynamic musical act paying tribute to the music of the legendary Eric Clapton. During a typical show, the band performs Clapton&#39;s work from such legendary bands as Cream, Blind Faith, Derek &amp; The Dominos, Delaney &amp; Bonnie, and The Beatles. Of course, Clapton&#39;s solo work from the &#39;70&#39;s to the present day is also well represented.
Bell Bottom Blues&#39;s repertoire includes some of Clapton&#39;s best-known work, including tracks like &#34;After Midnight,&#34; &#34;I Shot the Sheriff,&#34; &#34;Cocaine,&#34; &#34;Have You Ever Loved a Woman,&#34; &#34;Lay Down Sally,&#34; &#34;Layla,&#34; &#34;Tears in Heaven,&#34; &#34;Sunshine of Your Love,&#34; &#34;Wonderful Tonight,&#34; and of course, &#34;Bell Bottom Blues.&#34; Because of the passion and talent each musician brings to the band, they are able to capture the vocal and instrumental genius that is the essence of a Clapton performance. This group&#39;s goal is to provide the audience with the ultimate Clapton experience at each and every show.

One of the most exciting and dynamic trumpeters on the current scene, Joey Morant works as a soloist, in duet and trio settings, and as a part of larger bands and orchestras, including the Lincoln Center Orchestra and the Harlem Blues Jazz Band. In addition, he has performed with jazz, soul, and rock &#39;n&#39; roll greats, including Paul McCartney, Ray Charles, Lionel Hampton, and James Brown. He electrifies audiences with his dazzling horn technique, skillful scat singing, and humorous asides. His Louis Armstrong interpretations, both playing and singing, are extraordinary.
Morant is a native Charlestonian, a brass instrumentalist and vocalist. He is the quintessential trumpeter from the Jenkins Orphanage band tradition of the 1950s. At age 11, inspired by the piano, he became interested in classical music. When Fletcher Linton, a teacher at Charleston&#39;s Henry P. Archer Elementary School, put a school band together, Morant began studying the trumpet. A generous benefactor, recognizing his talent, arranged for him to spend the summers of his high school years studying theory at the Berklee School of Music. By age 15, Morant was teaching theory and saxophone to Oscar Rivers. Later, he joined the Metronome All-Stars under the direction of music educator Melvin Hodges, Jr., a member of the 1996 Olympic Committee.
Known as &#34;Mr. Entertainer,&#34; Morant has traveled the world - Russia, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Germany, France, and Mexico - performing in an array of venues, including the London Paladium with Frankie Lymon and a performance for Queen Elizabeth. He has performed and recorded with hundreds of musicians, including the Harlem Blues and Jazz Band, Ray Charles, James Brown, Tina Turner, George Benson, Lionel Hampton&#39;s Orchestra, Paul McCartney, Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Goodman, Woody Herman, and Jabbo Smith. He has also performed regularly with a septet at Merv Griffin&#39;s Hotel Resorts International in Atlantic City.
In Charleston, Morant was a regular performer at the Chef and Clef and conducted a 17-piece orchestra at the Dock Street Theatre. He is a former director of Charleston&#39;s MOJA Arts Festival. He also credits himself with starting the first jazz society in Toronto and having guitarist George Benson tour with him for two years. He has written and recorded with Lee Morgan and worked with Art Blakey on the arrangement of Aretha Franklin&#39;s rendition of &#34;Dixie Melody&#34; for her first album, recorded with saxophonist King Curtis. His first recording, Better Late Than Never, was released in 1998.
Morant won Showtime at the Apollo and has performed on Black Entertainment Television&#39;s Jazz Discovery program. He received heartfelt recognition from around the world for his deeply-moving musical tribute at Ground Zero on December 11, 2001, and in 2003 he received the Harlem Jazz and Music Festival Instrumentalist of the Year award. For 35 years, he has also been a martial artist with Shoto-Kwon Do Productions, a company he owns in Jersey City, where he resides.Joey Morant hails from South Carolina and electrifies audiences with his dazzling horn technique, skillful scat singing, and humorous asides. His Louis Armstrong interpretations, both playing and singing, are perfect, and his admiration for Louis is deep and genuine.Wednesday afterwork at Sky Room Times Square is a great rootop venue.

 Harlem Blues Project specializes in soulful New York blues with a twist! The band features blues masters Jerry Dugger, Junior Mack, Saron Crenshaw, and Barry Harrison.
Jerry was raised in Harlem and caught the music bug early in life. A fateful walk through Washington Square Park found him being introduced to the New York City Blues scene by way of the now infamous Dan Lynch Blues Bar. Jerry spent the next thirteen years learning to play Bass and sing, while also hosting the Saturday and Sunday Blues Jams. There Jerry Shared his stage with Stevie Ray Vaughan, Johnny Copeland, James Cotton and many more Blues Artists. His Bass baritone voice and thunderous bass playing have earned him a place in New York&#39;s Blues Hall of Fame. Jerry&#39;s band &#34;The Dugger Brothers&#34; are a staple on the New York City Blues scene.
SaRon is an extremely talented guitarist who travels the country playing Blues, Rhythm and Blues and Jazz, he has been inspired by some of the greatest singers and players of all time, B.B. King, Albert King, Albert Collins, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Buddy Guy to name a few. SaRon plays a Gibson &#34;Lucille&#34; model guitar signed by B.B. King himself. He is a powerful entertainer and is never afraid to take his performance straight into the audience. He has shared stages with talented recording artists such as Denise Lasalle, Bobby Rush, And Tyrone Davis.
Influenced by Duane Allman, Dickey Betts, Jan Akkerman, and Wes Montgomery, Junior Mack deftly displays these influences, although the foundation of his playing lies in the soulfulness of Gospel and Blues. An opportunity to play for the late Pops Staples and the encouraging reaction from both Pops and Mavis Staples was the first in a chain of events that drove Mack to present his interpretation of the blues to a wider audience. He has sat in or worked with The Allman Brothers Band, Derek Trucks, Robert Randolph, Dickey Betts, and Honeyboy Edwards. He has also recorded an excellent CD, Live Adventures.
Drummer Barry Harrison spent five and a half years with the legendary Johnny Copeland, and after his passing, Harrison went on to spend six years working with his daughter, Shemekia Copeland. He has also worked with Sonny Rhodes, Eddie Kirkland, Phil Guy, and Lonnie Shields.PRESENTERS AND PERFORMERS AT THE DAY OF TIKKUN NEW YORK CITY

Witch house dance-party with open bar to follow performances. facebook.com/silentdraperunnersJoin us as we transform South Presbyterian Church’s Fellowship Hall into a swing dance ballroom, featuring The Abbie Gardner Swing Band! Best known as one-third of the female harmony Americana trio Red Molly, Abbie Gardner has listened to the sweet sound of high lonesome harmonies since her first bluegrass festival at three years old. Her father, Herb Gardner, who will accompany his daughter this evening, is a swing jazz and stride pianist and dixieland trombonist. He introduced Abbie to one of her favorite vocalists, Billie Holiday, and continues to be a big influence on the musician she is and strives to be.
Abbie studied classical flute growing up, but once she started playing Dobro in 2004 she found her main instrument. She traveled to Lyons, CO and Nashville, TN to study with Rob Ickes and Sally Van Meter. Left to her own devices, without many Dobro influences near NYC, Abbie continues to develop her style by listening to other instrumentalists, such as David Rawlings, Ry Cooder and Bonnie Raitt. Always keen on following the vocal part and trying to find the one really perfect note, instead of a dozen okay ones, Abbie is quickly compiling an extensive discography of recording credits.
She recorded three full-length albums and one EP with Red Molly, the last of which spent several weeks in the Top 10 on the Radio &amp; Records Americana Chart (Spring 2010).   In 2008, She released Bad Nights/Better Days a duo record of original material with Anthony da Costa. The album was featured on WFUV’s top 2008 album lists and has been described as a work of staggering emotional power. (Acoustic Live! in NYC, 2008)
Abbie’s first full-length recording, My Craziest Dream is an album of jazz standards featuring her father on piano. It earned her an entry in the 2009 Hal Leonard book The Jazz Singers: The Ultimate Guide and she is pleased to perform selections from that record, along with other standards, with her band.
Abbie has a strong throaty voice that’s reminiscent of Wesla Whitfield’s… she uses it to render evergreens from the 1920s and 1930s with a crew of guys who play like they were around when this music was the cat’s pajamas.  (Cadence Magazine, June 2004)
Her 2006 release Honey on My Grave was her first independently released CD of mostly original music spanning varied genres with consistently strong Dobro, guitar, and vocal performances.  (Chronogram, 2006)
Abbie has been recognized as an award-winning songwriter, as well, with such accolades as; 2008 Lennon Award Winner (folk) for “The Mind of a Soldier” and 2008 American Songwriter Magazine Grand Prize Lyric Winner for “I’d Rather Be”. Her song “Honey on My Grave” was also published in Sing Out! Magazine in 2008.
Abbie continues to tour with Red Molly, currently promoting their fourth full-length CD, Light the Sky.  Her latest solo CD “Hope” was released in April 2011.

Learn about Miles Davis, Charles Mingus and the other experimenters who made New York a key city in the history of jazz music. Walk the streets of New York and find the jazz hot spots where the artists and musicians hung out and learn about the influences of these on the movement. The city is still home to dozens of historic jazz and blues clubs where the likes of Charlie Parker, Duke Ellington and Fats Waller all paid their dues including The Village Vanguard and The Lenox Lounge.

New York City had the earliest documented punk rock scene in the United States and by 1985, the New York hardcore scene had become inhabited by straight edgers and skinheads. Walk in the steps of The Ramones and The Velvet Underground and visit some of the well known venues which saw bands such as Talking Heads, Blondie and Suicide play. You will also learn about the Indie movement which, some might argue, was born in New York City.

The band captures the true spirit of what this music is all about, motivating people to get up and dance to each and every song it performs.
Paying homage to soul legends, Groove Buffet has an extensive song library from which it crafts each show&#39;s set list, providing an entire night of material featuring the sounds of Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Al Green, Gladys Knight, Marvin Gaye, James Brown, Tina Turner, Wilson Pickett, and many more.
&#34;Groove Buffet is certainly not some wedding band performing Motown and soul. They are a driving high-energy band that&#39;s more like seeing Otis live in concert with Booker T and the MGs behind him&#34;
-John Cotelli, Jazz Itailia MagazineThe Gipsy Kings consist of two bands of brothers: the Reyes (Nicolas, Canut, Paul, Patchai, Andre) and the Baliardos (Tonino, Paco, Diego). The Reyes and Baliardo boys were the offspring of Spanish gypsy families that had fled into France to escape Spain&#39;s Civil War. They grew up roaming the south of France, working harvests and making music.
Jose Reyes - father of the GK&#39;s Reyes - sang alongside guitarist Manitas de Plata and did much to popularise flamenco internationally: John Steinbeck, Charlie Chaplin, Pablo Picasso, Miles Davis and Salvador Dali were amongst the duo&#39;s admirers. Jose split from Manitas in the 1970s and formed Los Reyes with his teenage sons. His death devastated the Reyes yet lead to their fortuitous encounter with the Baliardos at the St. Marie de la Mer Gitan pilgrimage. On that warm night, as they passed the guitar, shared songs and wine, history was shaped.
Initially, the Reyes and Baliardos busked on the streets of Cannes, played weddings and parties, young men flavouring flamenco with Western pop and Latin rhythms. When an American admirer told the band their name Los Reyes meant &#34;The Kings&#34; in English they realised they were born to be Gipsy Kings. In 1987 The Gipsy Kings&#39; self-titled debut album introduced the world to `rumba Gitano&#39; - the sound of South America&#39;s rumba rhythm married to flamenco guitars - and with `Bamboleo&#39; the Gipsy Kings scored a huge international hit. Since then the Kings have never stopped singing to the world.
Today the Gipsy Kings still live with their families in the south of France. Life may have changed for them - they no longer busk on streets or pick crops when times are hard or travel in caravans - but still, at heart, they remain Gypsies, the proud descendants of an ancient people who seduced the world with music and dance. On Pasajero, the Gipsy Kings continue their epic musical journey.Founded solely on passion for the music, Groove Buffet has become one of the best classic R&amp;B, Motown, and soul acts on the East Coast.

“I think what&#39;s great about the film is though there have been a lot of things done on Bob, I think this one will give people a more emotional connection to Bob&#39;s life as a man – not just as a reggae legend or a mythical figure, but his life as a man.”
 
 – Ziggy Marley

 
 
SYNOPSIS
 
 
 
Bob Marley&#39;s universal appeal, impact on music history and role as a social and political prophet is both unique and unparalleled. MARLEY is the definitive life story of the musician, revolutionary, and legend, from his early days to his rise to international superstardom. Made with the support of the Marley family, the film features rare footage, incredible performances and revelatory interviews with the people that knew him best.
 
From Academy Award-winning director Kevin Macdonald  (One Day In September, The Last King of Scotland) comes the story of a towering figure of musical history, whose music and message has transcended different cultures, languages and creeds to resonate around the world today as powerfully as when he was alive. 
 
MARLEY will make its world premiere at the Berlin Film Festival this month followed by its North American premiere at SXSW.  Magnolia Pictures will release theatrically and on VOD on Friday, April 20th. 
 ABOUT THE FILM
 
For nearly half a century, Bob Marley – the musician, the revolutionary, the legend – has influenced various populations at a global level that remains unparalleled. Marley’s passing in May 1981 not only left a huge void in what is perhaps modern music’s most spiritual and yet accessible genre, reggae, but also, as a testament to the star’s power, set the stage for the unprecedented, posthumous growth of his fan base.
 
The enduring nature of Bob Marley’s fame is anything but a simple pop music phenomenon. Just one index of it is the success of the Marley compilation album “Legend,” which is one of only 17 albums to pass the 10-million mark in sales (in 2009), continues to sell at the rate of about 250,000 albums per year, and is the second-longest charting album in the history of Billboard magazine’s record-keeping. With an ever-growing fanbase (as evidenced by his 33+ million roster of fans on Facebook and Twitter), his fame has elevated his stature to one of a spiritual beacon.
 
More than 30 years later, the undying messages that go beyond his music make Marley a cultural force to be reckoned with. His way of living was in many ways a political act on the world stage, across the world’s continents. Today, wherever politically minded youth seeks ways to find solidarity (as was exemplified over recent months by the popularity of Bob Marley’s music and imagery amidst scenes of protest in the Middle East and Africa and at the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations and its many offshoots), they find him to be an ever-potent cultural touchstone. And yet, for all the loyalty shown to the icon, and all the renewing excitement for those still discovering his legacy, many mysteries and unanswered questions have remained. A glut of concert films, biographies, DVDs and unauthorized videos already have attempted to explore his story over the years since his death, but the man himself remains almost as enigmatic as he is beloved. 

Now, through the unprecedented, combined efforts of the Marley family, Oscar-winning master filmmaker Kevin Macdonald (The Last King of Scotland, Life in a Day, One Day in September) and Shangri-La Entertainment (Shine a Light, Heart of Gold), many of those questions have been given an answer, and many of those mysteries have in great part been solved. 
 
“The thing at the back of my mind,” Macdonald explains, “the question I wanted to answer in making the film, was: Why does he still speak to people around the world (because it&#39;s clear that he does) and why does he speak to people so much more profoundly than any other rock artist or popular music artist….What I was fascinated to try to do in this film was to make something very personal. Who is this man? Why did he become so successful? What was the message that he had to give out to people?”
 
With his documentary MARLEY, which was made with the full cooperation of the Marley family and embraced a variety of sources and speakers who have previously gone unheard, Macdonald brings the legacy into a new generation and lends an often exuberant and moving perspective to a legend.
 
Beyond the joyous and upbeat quality of many of the film’s sequences (Bob’s music was uplifting even in its darker moments), the film delivers a depth of information and insights that would have been impossible without the kind of cooperation the Marley family have offered. Bob’s wife Rita and his children, friends and musical colleagues, have opened their hearts, minds and memories to Macdonald and his team. As a result, their expansive interviews and the unparalleled and unrestricted access to a trove of archival imagery mean that this film will stand as the one definitive record of the Bob Marley legacy. 
 
However, the filmmaker’s eventual attachment to the project came in stages, over a long period of time. 
 
“My first involvement at all with the universe of Bob Marley,” recalls Macdonald, “was about six or seven years ago. I was approached by [Island Records founder] Chris Blackwell about whether I wanted to do a film about what would have been Bob&#39;s 60th birthday celebration in Ethiopia. Chris had the idea to make a film about flying a load of Rastas from Jamaica to Ethiopia for the first time, and seeing the concert through their eyes. I thought this was a great idea, and so I did a lot of research about Jamaica, but nothing really came of it.”
At the time, Macdonald claimed only an interested layman’s knowledge of Bob Marley’s life and career. Like many casual fans worldwide, he knew the man so often referred to as a “reggae superstar” had achieved a level of popularity even more remarkable for its breadth across the globe than for its depth.
 
“Then I went off and made The Last King of Scotland, which I filmed in Kampala in Uganda. And one of the things that really struck me – because I had Bob Marley on my mind a little bit – was that as I wandered around, particularly in the poorer areas of Kampala, I saw all these Bob Marley images everywhere – on flags and graffiti, with lyrics put up all over the place – quotes from his songs. And I thought, ‘This is amazing. What is it about Marley that has traveled the world? What is it that means something even in Africa, even in Uganda of all places?’”

Then, in March 2010, Macdonald received a phone call from the producers at Shangri-La Entertainment to tell him that they – including Shangri-La founder Steve Bing – were committed to making the definitive movie about Marley, and that Chris Blackwell had recommended him as a possible director. Macdonald says that he has now come to believe that he was simply destined to be the man to tell this unforgettable story.
 
“What is to be must be – that old saying is something that we really believe in,” says Bob’s oldest son, David “Ziggy” Marley. “So Kevin was supposed to do the documentary, is how we look at it. I wasn&#39;t worried, I wasn&#39;t fussing….I knew it would get done, and I knew it would get done by whoever was supposed to do it in the first place.”
 
And so, Macdonald would begin the process of working with the Marley family – chiefly Ziggy, his sister Cedella (named for Bob’s mother), and their mother, Bob’s wife, Rita Marley. 
 
“The attitude I had,” Macdonald remembers, “was to persuade them nothing good has really been made in terms of a documentary about Bob, and now was the time to do it before even more people pass away. That&#39;s what I said to Ziggy when I first met him – I said, ‘I want to do the most conventional thing possible. I want to go out with a camera and interview absolutely everybody.  I&#39;m not going to just stick with who they’ve talked to before.’…. A problem with a lot of the big stars – in particular Bob because he&#39;s almost got this image of a prophet – is that people forget to ask the personal questions – what was his family like?  His father? Why was he like he was? Why was he so driven?”
Of course to aid his compelling narrative, Macdonald has used some of the great Bob Marley material – including “Exodus,” “No Woman, No Cry” – in addition to a few obscure but illuminating discoveries. But he discovered that, despite yeoman work by seasoned archival researcher Sam Dwyer, there was precious little material to be found, either from the musician’s youth, or from his fledgling years as a reggae performer. 
“Obviously one of the challenges with Bob is that there&#39;s so little great archive footage,” said Macdonald. “There&#39;s nothing at all of the first 11 years of his career.  From 1962 to 1973 there&#39;s not a single piece of footage, and only a handful of photographs.”
Case in point: The Wailers, the breakthrough group that Bob formed with Peter Tosh and Neville “Bunny” Livingston, once simultaneously had five of the top 10 singles on the Jamaican charts early in their career, yet despite their relative prominence at the time, the interest and infrastructure necessary to chronicle their career was simply lacking.
“It just shows a lot about what Jamaica was like then,” said Macdonald, “and what the standing of Jamaican music was as well – that nobody filmed the Wailers, nor, for many years, took them seriously.”
So in interviewing some 60 people, with maybe half of those interviews being cut into the film, the director had Marley’s ongoing legacy in mind: “That’s history that can go into the archive.” With what he does include in the film, Macdonald lets Bob’s story be told by the voices of those who knew him best. 
Macdonald credits Bunny has one of two key interview subjects included in the film, who guide the audience through the film – especially Bunny, who knew Bob since they were children, and whose recollections take the audience through until 1973, and the split in the band. After that, the chief narrative duties are taken over by Neville Garrick, the Wailers’ artistic director, who was with Bob through the remainder of his life. Garrick was, like Bunny, “very articulate and inventive with language,” Macdonald recalls. “Both of them were very fun to listen to.”
Given the mixed feelings many Jamaican performers, and the Rastafarians especially, have about the music business culture they came up in, enlisting Bunny and some others was no simple task. “It took us many, many months. He was suspicious and felt the story of the original Wailers had not been told accurately in the past. And he feels that, as the last survivor of the Wailers, he wants to shape that history, understandably, because he feels he, and the story, have been misrepresented. It took a long time to persuade him that we wanted to make a fair and balanced film, and the people putting up the money to make the film don&#39;t actually have the final say. This is a completely independent project.
“Once Bunny signed on, he gave the interview a full and willing day, and came appropriately robed, and accessorized,” says Macdonald. “He&#39;s very conscious of his look and the thing that I was most impressed with was the pipe that he had with him, which was made out of a carrot. He clutched this carrot all day. And I said, ‘What is the carrot?’  He said, ‘it&#39;s my pipe,’ and he was puffing on this all day. That seemed highly appropriate for a man called Bunny.”
“An important part of the process was to discover people like Dudley Sibley, who&#39;s the recording artist, and studio janitor, in Studio One, and lived with Bob for a year or two in the back room there. Nobody had ever interviewed him before – perhaps they felt he was kind of a goofy-looking guy who&#39;s maybe a little crazy. But actually he was fascinating and his memories were unsullied, and he had this firsthand insight of living cheek by jowl with Bob in this room before he was Bob, as it were.”
The filmmaker’s exhaustive interviewing process resulted in a number of other unexpected – and otherwise unavailable – revelations, including from Bob&#39;s close white cousin Peter, who Macdonald says “nobody had thought to speak with before.” 
“A real key for me,” says Macdonald, “was trying to understand the importance to Bob’s life that he was of mixed race.  It’s hard for some of us in both Europe and America to understand the stigma attached to that. And Bob, coming as he did from the deep countryside in his own day, one of the truly black parts of Jamaica, felt that stigma attached to being of mixed race, and not just from the white side of the island but also from the black side.”
Cedella says that she felt confident that Macdonald, perhaps best known for illuminating both the mythic and shabby sides of dictator Idi Amin as portrayed on film by Forrest Whitaker, would delve knowledgeably into the issues of race and colonialism that ran as threads throughout Jamaican life, from the island’s harsh colonial legacy through the rise of Rastafarianism. 
“By coincidence I had just watched The Last King of Scotland when Chris called me and said, `Listen, I have this director in mind.’  And when he told me, I said, `Really? I just watched something that he made, and it was just so real.’”
Cedella was particularly struck by the presence of Bob’s half-sister, Constance, who is depicted in the film listening to the song “Cornerstone,” written by Bob after an unsatisfactory and remote meeting with his white uncle. Constance was clearly moved.  “I’m glad Auntie Constance was in here,” says Cedella. “She knew Grandpa’s [Norval Marley] family better than Dad did.” 
The director’s access to the Marley family proved invaluable when it came to understanding many of the deeply moving and sometimes surprising truths about Bob’s life and relationships which their conversations revealed – many tremendously personal details, which brought to the film, for the first time, a full and rounded portrait of the musician and the man.
Macdonald found himself touched by the grace Rita Marley showed in speaking of Bob’s rather wandering eye. Of Rita, Macdonald says: “She comes out of the film to me as someone who&#39;s quite noble in a way, because she&#39;s clearly had to put up with a lot on a personal level. You feel [Bob] obviously caused her pain and caused Cedella, their daughter, pain in the way he had behaved. But they not only forgive it, they clearly feel that what he was doing was so important, and that the message that he was spreading was so much more important than those details of personal feeling.”

 Rita’s words in the film only deepened Cedella’s respect for her mother. “I said to her, `Mom, they don&#39;t make women like you anymore.’ I guess, back in the ’60s, when you fall in love like that, you fall in love, you know? There are days when I go into my mom&#39;s room and she&#39;ll be talking and I know there&#39;s nobody in the room.  So I&#39;ll knock on the door and I&#39;ll say, `Mom, who are you talking to?’ And she will say, `Oh, my boyfriend, Robbie.’ That’s what she called Dad. ‘What are you guys talking about?’ And she says, `I&#39;m just making sure he&#39;s taking care of himself.’ She just loves my dad. She loves him. It&#39;s not that she&#39;s not going to get angry if he&#39;s doing what he&#39;s doing, you know? But she loves him beyond that.” 
Among the other interviews conducted was one with the legendarily private and diffident Chris Blackwell, who, Cedella says, was vigilant in keeping the focus on the star and not the Island Records label head who guided him. “He’s always telling me, ‘You know I never liked taking a picture with Bob’,” remembers Cedella, “but Dad respected Chris and his ear.”
 For Marley’s son Ziggy, the key revelatory moment in the film is the testimony of the nurse who shepherded his father through some of the agonizing final days of his terminal cancer in a European clinic. “Some of that I hadn’t heard or seen before, and that was very emotional and insightful,” he says. 
“I think what&#39;s great about the film,” Ziggy continues, “is though there&#39;s been a lot of things done on Bob, I think this one will give people a more emotional connection to Bob&#39;s life as a man. Not just as a reggae legend or a mythical figure, but his life as a man, you know? The struggles he went through.”

 
Macdonald’s summation of MARLEY is a testament to the deeper insight he has achieved: “I feel that that one of the reasons Bob has lived on is because he speaks to the oppressed people of the world, be they in the United States, or Britain or Germany, but more than anything else, he speaks to people in the developing world who feel like they&#39;ve been given a bum deal, who feel like they&#39;ve been hopped over by the west or whatever.  And here&#39;s a voice telling them, `Your turn will come.  You&#39;re down now but you&#39;re going to get up there.’”

 Duwende (Doo-WEN-day) is an award-winning six-person a cappella group based out of New York. Each member of the group adds his or her own characteristics and talent to the group, giving the ensemble the credibility of an a cappella outfit and the persona of a band. The group is best known for its fiercely original, bass-and-beatbox-driven funk and pop style of music and has headlined major a cappella festivals such as the East Coast Summit, SoJam, and AcappellaStock.
Duwende&#39;s albums Radio Screaming (2004) and Collective (2007) won the 2005 and 2008 Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards for Best Pop/Rock Album and Best Pop/Rock Original Song from The Contemporary A Cappella Society. Billboard Magazine also chose the group as &#34;One of the Top Indie Acts to Look Out For.&#34; More recently, Duwende released a Michael Jackson tribute album titled Remember: The Music of Michael Jackson (2011), which contains covers of some of The King of Pop&#39;s biggest hits, including &#34;Billie Jean,&#34; &#34;Black or White,&#34; and &#34;Rock with You.&#34; The members of Duwende, who cite MJ as their biggest inspiration, put their own original spin on his classic songs, showcasing their versatility and creativity. The collection is the band&#39;s first cover album. Tonight, in honor of Jackson&#39;s birthday, Duwende will perform cuts from the album, along with numerous surprises.Collectively, Prince and Michael Jackson helped define the early &#39;80s era of MTV, revolutionized both R&amp;B and popular music, and influenced thousands of musicians worldwide. The Prince and Michael Experience is meant to celebrate the music of two of the biggest pop cultural icons of our generation – a celebration carried out with love and mutual respect for both artists.
The music is far from the only thing happening at this party. There&#39;s theme dancing, a face-off between guests repping The Purple One or The King of Pop, and much, much more. This is the perfect night out to lounge with your friends, make some new friends, get your drink on, dance your ass off, and have the time of your life. Prince and Michael Jackson fans go toe-to-toe on the dance floor as DJ Dave Paul from San Francisco mixes album cuts, remixes, rare tracks, and hits from the two artists. The party also features special guests from Chicago: Ed Hollis as The King of Pop, and Marcus Scott as The Purple One.
Dave Paul began his music career in 1984, starting as a mobile DJ and evolving into a prominent college radio and club DJ remixer in San Francisco. During the late &#39;80s and early &#39;90s, his weekly radio show Beat Box Fridays on college radio station KCSF was instrumental in breaking many hip-hop records in the Bay Area market.

Yes. Unless You Have A Hard Copy Official TicketA native of New Jersey, self-taught blues musician Junior Mack has been playing guitar since the age of nine. An opportunity to play for the late Pops Staples early in his career, and the encouraging reaction from both Pops and Mavis Staples, was the first in a chain of events that drove him to present his interpretation of the blues to a wider audience. Since then, Mack has developed the stage presence of a seasoned performer, lulling, mesmerizing, and reeling the audience into a groove all his own. His soulful interpretation of the blues never fails to captivate.
Mack&#39;s guitar playing influences include Duane Allman, Dickey Betts, Jan Akkerman, and Wes Montgomery, although the foundation of his playing lies in the soulfulness of gospel and blues. Vocally, his influences are all gospel. The Soul Stirrers with Sam Cooke and Paul Foster and The Sensational Nightingales with Reverend Julius Cheeks proved the initial inspiration for his delivery, and the influence of Greg Allman later added a distinct flavor to his sound.
Mack has been member of the Jaimoe Jasssz Band since 2006 and has sat in or worked with The Allman Brothers Band, Warren Haynes, Gov&#39;t Mule, Derek Trucks, Robert Randolph, Dickey Betts, Honeyboy Edwards, Cyndi Lauper, and more. He has also recorded an excellent solo album, titled Live Adventures.

Their extensive background includes tribute acts for The Beach Boys, The Blues Brothers, Jay &amp; The Americans, and Huey Lewis and The News.

 As New York&#39;s premier Eagles tribute band, Desert Highway has quickly made a name for itself as the best Eagles tribute band around. Despite the fact that the band has only been together for less than three years, it have gained a reputation as the most accurate-sounding Eagles tribute band in the country. This band&#39;s renditions of Eagles classics have been recognized by leaders in the industry like Jack Tempchin (composer of &#34;Peaceful Easy Feeling&#34;) and have received praise throughout North America and Europe.
Desert Highway has quickly risen through the ranks of the NY tribute scene, moving from opening act to headliner status almost overnight. One listen to this band is all it will take to make even the most die-hard Eagles lover a fan for life!

One of the most exciting and dynamic trumpeters on the current scene, Joey Morant works as a soloist, in duet and trio settings, and as a part of larger bands and orchestras, including the Lincoln Center Orchestra and the Harlem Blues Jazz Band. In addition, he has performed with jazz, soul, and rock &#39;n&#39; roll greats, including Paul McCartney, Ray Charles, Lionel Hampton, and James Brown. He electrifies audiences with his dazzling horn technique, skillful scat singing, and humorous asides. His Louis Armstrong interpretations, both playing and singing, are extraordinary.
Morant is a native Charlestonian, a brass instrumentalist and vocalist. He is the quintessential trumpeter from the Jenkins Orphanage band tradition of the 1950s. At age 11, inspired by the piano, he became interested in classical music. When Fletcher Linton, a teacher at Charleston&#39;s Henry P. Archer Elementary School, put a school band together, Morant began studying the trumpet. A generous benefactor, recognizing his talent, arranged for him to spend the summers of his high school years studying theory at the Berklee School of Music. By age 15, Morant was teaching theory and saxophone to Oscar Rivers. Later, he joined the Metronome All-Stars under the direction of music educator Melvin Hodges, Jr., a member of the 1996 Olympic Committee.
Known as &#34;Mr. Entertainer,&#34; Morant has traveled the world - Russia, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Germany, France, and Mexico - performing in an array of venues, including the London Paladium with Frankie Lymon and a performance for Queen Elizabeth. He has performed and recorded with hundreds of musicians, including the Harlem Blues and Jazz Band, Ray Charles, James Brown, Tina Turner, George Benson, Lionel Hampton&#39;s Orchestra, Paul McCartney, Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Goodman, Woody Herman, and Jabbo Smith. He has also performed regularly with a septet at Merv Griffin&#39;s Hotel Resorts International in Atlantic City.
In Charleston, Morant was a regular performer at the Chef and Clef and conducted a 17-piece orchestra at the Dock Street Theatre. He is a former director of Charleston&#39;s MOJA Arts Festival. He also credits himself with starting the first jazz society in Toronto and having guitarist George Benson tour with him for two years. He has written and recorded with Lee Morgan and worked with Art Blakey on the arrangement of Aretha Franklin&#39;s rendition of &#34;Dixie Melody&#34; for her first album, recorded with saxophonist King Curtis. His first recording, Better Late Than Never, was released in 1998.
Morant won Showtime at the Apollo and has performed on Black Entertainment Television&#39;s Jazz Discovery program. He received heartfelt recognition from around the world for his deeply-moving musical tribute at Ground Zero on December 11, 2001, and in 2003 he received the Harlem Jazz and Music Festival Instrumentalist of the Year award. For 35 years, he has also been a martial artist with Shoto-Kwon Do Productions, a company he owns in Jersey City, where he resides.General Admission Sunday Pass + Ferry

It&#39;s an experience!Harlem Blues Project specializes in soulful New York blues with a twist! The band features blues masters Jerry Dugger, Junior Mack, Saron Crenshaw, and Barry Harrison.
Jerry was raised in Harlem and caught the music bug early in life. A fateful walk through Washington Square Park found him being introduced to the New York City Blues scene by way of the now infamous Dan Lynch Blues Bar. Jerry spent the next thirteen years learning to play Bass and sing, while also hosting the Saturday and Sunday Blues Jams. There Jerry Shared his stage with Stevie Ray Vaughan, Johnny Copeland, James Cotton and many more Blues Artists. His Bass baritone voice and thunderous bass playing have earned him a place in New York&#39;s Blues Hall of Fame. Jerry&#39;s band &#34;The Dugger Brothers&#34; are a staple on the New York City Blues scene.
SaRon is an extremely talented guitarist who travels the country playing Blues, Rhythm and Blues and Jazz, he has been inspired by some of the greatest singers and players of all time, B.B. King, Albert King, Albert Collins, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Buddy Guy to name a few. SaRon plays a Gibson &#34;Lucille&#34; model guitar signed by B.B. King himself. He is a powerful entertainer and is never afraid to take his performance straight into the audience. He has shared stages with talented recording artists such as Denise Lasalle, Bobby Rush, And Tyrone Davis.
Influenced by Duane Allman, Dickey Betts, Jan Akkerman, and Wes Montgomery, Junior Mack deftly displays these influences, although the foundation of his playing lies in the soulfulness of Gospel and Blues. An opportunity to play for the late Pops Staples and the encouraging reaction from both Pops and Mavis Staples was the first in a chain of events that drove Mack to present his interpretation of the blues to a wider audience. He has sat in or worked with The Allman Brothers Band, Derek Trucks, Robert Randolph, Dickey Betts, and Honeyboy Edwards. He has also recorded an excellent CD, Live Adventures.
Drummer Barry Harrison spent five and a half years with the legendary Johnny Copeland, and after his passing, Harrison went on to spend six years working with his daughter, Shemekia Copeland. He has also worked with Sonny Rhodes, Eddie Kirkland, Phil Guy, and Lonnie Shields.Dance and sing, get up and do your thing!

We&#39;ll be showing classic Madonna videos on the big screen and will have special live musical Madonna Karaoke. We&#39;ll also have food and drink specials. Space is limited - this event will sell out, so get your ticketsCelebrating their 20th anniversary as modern day rulers of old school funk, the seven-piece Brooklyn-based juggernaut Lettuce drops their third studio album Fly—a decidedly raging slab of relentless groove, hyper-charged syncopation and psychedelicized soul anthems. Having blown up stages from coast to coast last year, ranging from The Fillmore in SF to Terminal 5 in NYC, Bear Creek Music Festival to Camp Bisco and all points in-between, Lettuce entered Brooklyn recording studio The Bunker this winter with a fresh batch of road-tested material and a revitalized sound honed razor sharp by a year spent on the road.  
 
“We’re more together and set to crush than ever before,” says drummer and chief songwriter Adam Deitch of the all-star group that he and his accomplished band-mates cut their teeth with back in their Berklee School of Music days. That much history, along with the A-list crop of projects that each member has taken on away from Lettuce, gives the group a bottomless well of musical ideas and unrivaled chemistry—in fact, referring to themselves as a band of brothers. “I was in a practice room at 16 with Kraz, Zoidis, Shmeeans and Deitch and it all clicked,” says “lead” bassist Erick “Jesus” Coomes. “We all felt rhythms in similar ways. We were all about the pocket from day one.” 
 
On Fly, the pocket is deeper than ever. “People tend to look at funk as a one-trick pony, “ says Deitch, but the record smashes those limits by drawing on a range of styles that can be traced from the early ’60s through the early ’80s, incorporating plenty of modern hip-hop sensibilities—heavy bass, kick and snare—along the way. 
 
The album’s one cover song, an all-instrumental version of War’s “Slippin’ into Darkness,” is a reminder of the genre’s vintage origins but from there on up, the track progression emphasizes the band’s ability to steer funk in a new direction. “I sketched out a bunch of ideas for songs that I felt would fit each musician perfectly,” says Deitch, leaving plenty of space for each to add their own style to the mix. As a rhythm section, Coomes and Deitch set the pace with a deep and wide pocket. Guitarists Eric Krasno and Adam &#34;Shmeeans&#34; Smirnoff weave electrified six-string rhythms that summon the magic of The JBs&#39; Catfish Collins/Hearlon &#34;Cheese&#34; Martin dual guitar frontline, while Keyboardist Neal &#34;The Hawk&#34; Evans doubles up the low end as he simultaneously floats and stings with jabs of Hammond B3 organ.  Riding along in lockstep is saxophonist Ryan &#34;Zwad&#34; Zoidis and trumpeter Rashawn Ross punctuating the Lettuce funk with blasts of big, bold and infectious horn lines, while guest appearances by Brian “BT” Thomas and Cochemea “Cheme” Gastelum further solidify what is already one of the fiercest horn sections of this era. “We try to keep the horn lines simple and melodic, leaving plenty of space for our insanely funky rhythm section to shine,” says Zoidis. “We are always thinking about making people dance.” Soul vocalist Nigel Hall comes in on the Krasno-penned track, “Do It Like You Do” and Charles “Dawg” Haynes provides added percussion on “Let It GOGO.” 
 
Look no further than Fly’s title track, though, for what sets these guys apart. The laid-back vamp, recorded all-analog to two-inch tape, gets full Jamaican studio treatment, dubbed out with vintage reverb and delay. That sort of thing is “only something that Funkadelic might have touched on back in the day,” says Smirnoff. Meanwhile, tracks like “Madison Square” and “Ziggowatt” (Deitch’s ode to legendary Meters’ drummer Zigaboo Modeliste) sound like futuristic cuts from the Stax back catalog. “It’s somewhere between old school and new school,” Zoidis says of the sounds the band was able to achieve with engineer John Davis. Evans’ “Bowler” may be the best evidence of where this supercharged group is headed, with a tasty, stick-in-your-ear melody that continues through the track and begs to be ripped open onstage. “All these experiences as individuals have helped us grow in our own direction, be influenced by more things and have more things to bring to the table as a group,” Smirnoff says. “When you have that many variables, it’s a brand new project every time.”
 
Having evolved and refocused since 2008’s Rage! without ever dropping the beat, Lettuce is getting ready to take audiences to the cosmos with Fly in the trunk and a high-octane tour on the horizon. “Lettuce is like a Learjet that wasn’t getting clearance from the tower,” says Jesus. “But we’re done just rolling around on the runway.” They’re not asking for permission, so put your tray tables in their full, upright and locked position. This plane’s itching for lift off.
  Ricky Mix Entertainment presents The Punany Poets perfoming 
THE HEAD DOCTOR SHOW: CARIBBEAN EDITION featuring SLAM, Jessica Holter and Punany&#39;s Pearl
 
The evening begins with The Head Doctor’s Question &amp; Answer Exchange (30 minutes) and then moves seamlessly into a 90-minute performance of The Head Doctor Show, that is all at once fantastic and familiar, at times inviting audience members to become part of the act. The Head Doctor takes the audience on an emotional roller coaster ride of fantasy and pleasure that explores human sexuality, touching on issues of romance, dating, poverty, prostitution, marriage and sex in the age of HIV/AIDS… all while keeping it sexy and without being preachy or judgmental. The show is humorous, sexy, witty, wise and unforgettable.

 yesRob Morsberger is a singer-songwriter and classically-trained composer. His last album,’Ghosts Before Breakfast’, was featured on PRI/NPR, in USA Today, The Philadelphia Daily News, Boston Globe and more.

Their amazing three-part harmony singing, mixing Wendell&#39;s gruff and gravelly vocals with Popsy&#39;s soaring falsetto and Sherman&#39;s rich baritone brings the soul and spirit of gospel music into everything they perform. Equally gripping is the rhythmic foundation laid down by Sherman&#39;s bass playing and Popsy&#39;s drumming, perfectly complimenting Wendell&#39;s blues-soaked guitar solos and church-inspired piano playing. The band easily blends Saturday night&#39;s roadhouse rock with the gospel fervor and harmonies of Sunday morning&#39;s church service

A VERY SPECIAL DOUBLE BILL
Susan Werner and Vance Gilbert
Called the empress of the unexpected by NPR, singer-songwriter Susan Werner recently turned another corner in her multifaceted musical career with her vibrant 2011 album, Kicking the Beehive. It’s an 11-song collection of provocative, poignant, lyrical originals that are infused with the rustic roots of American folk, blues and country music. Produced by Rodney Crowell, recorded in Nashville and featuring such all-star guests as Vince Gill, Keb’ Mo’ and Paul Franklin, Kicking the Beehive is a personal project where Werner intuitively explores the full impact of looking beyond the superficial and delving into soulful honesty.
Sharing the bill will be Boston-based folksinger Vance Gilbert. A favorite on the U.S. coffeehouse, club, and festival circuit, Vance is blessed with a far ranging, almost otherworldly tenor voice. He&#39;s also an accomplished acoustic guitar player who incorporates elements of jazz, blues and country into his deft picking. Songs range from the personal to the political, and some seem informed by his former day job as a school teacher. He got his start on the folk scene in Cambridge, Mass., and has recorded duets with artists such as Christine Lavin and Patty Larkin.Since the release of &#34;Piano Man&#34; in 1973, Billy Joel has had 33 Top 40 hits spanning 3 decades, all written by the man himself.

Smith&#39;s fast-paced and widely-acclaimed R&amp;B/Soul Revue shows have created an international following. Carlton&#39;s magnificent stage presence and dynamic performances excite audiences all over the world from the United States to Europe and Asia.
Starting back in 2002 Carlton produced, hosted and performed in R&amp;B/Soul Revues in New York City&#39;s world-renowned B.B. King Blues Club &amp; Grill. Initially a one-show deal, his first performance sold-out and inspired the club to book him monthly for a series of tributes to stars including Al Green, James Brown, Curtis Mayfield, Sly &amp; The Family Stone, The Temptations, and Marvin Gaye. Carlton took the same show to The Blue Note in Las Vegas for a four-week run, and then performed in the Groove Series at The Blue Note in New York City.
For the past five years, Carlton has been living and working in Shanghai and from there has travelled all over Asia to entertain audiences.
Carlton portrayed the &#34;Godfather of Soul&#34; James Brown in Barry Levinson&#39;s motion picture &#34;Liberty Heights&#34; (1999), co-starring with Joe Mantegna, Bebe Neuwirth and Adrien Brody. When James Brown passed away in 2006, Carlton performed in his place alongside Chaka Khan on New Year&#39;s Eve at the B.B. King Blues Club, NYC. Carlton has also performed in the theatre, with a lead role in the Broadway musical &#34;Largo&#34; (by award-winning writer David Henry Hwang (&#34;Madame Butterfly&#34; and &#34;Aida&#34;)), appearing alongside Cyndi Lauper and Garth Hudson (of `60s super group The Band).
Carlton has made several recordings, including &#34;Carlton J. Smith Live at B. B. King&#39;s&#34;, &#34;Waiting&#34;, and &#34;Diagram Of A Relationship&#34; - a concept CD exploring the dynamics of a relationship from start to finish. Tom Waits is a personal favorite of Carlton, and has inspired his recording of &#34;The SkinnyBone Tree.&#34;
At present, Carlton is working on several recording projects, one of which is a live recording of the show he performed in James Brown&#39;s place New Year&#39;s Eve 2006 and the other is an all original R&amp;B CD.Jen Chapin’s music is urban folk — story songs that search for community and shared meaning, powered by the funk, soul and improvisation of the city.

” … One of the most important Jewish creative artists of the postwar era.” — The Jerusalem Post
Bill Monroe and John Coltrane poured into one person. .. He plays all those just great crazy jazz kind of licks, but with the heart and fire of Bill Monroe … I don’t know anyone else that approaches the mandolin the way he does.” —Ricky Skaggs, NPR
 
Had there been a planetarium in 19th century Galicia, or a kosher deli in Depression-era Kentucky, Andy Statman’s music might have been playing in the background. Meandering through time, geography and culture, the man and his inimitable hybrid sound move freely among the before, the after, and the present.
Andy Statman, one of his generation’s premier mandolinists and clarinetists, thinks of his compositions and performances as “spontaneous American-roots music and personal, prayerful hasidic music, by way of avant-garde jazz.” This modest man takes for granted that a performer might embody several worlds in his art, and seems humbled by the fact that his music, like his story, is extraordinary.
It’s a story Andy Statman rewrites with his trio every time they perform: “We’re creating an experience between the audience and us,” with their unconstrained meditations on hasidic music and groove-driven explorations of American-roots music. Statman’s long-time collaborators are bassist Jim Whitney and percussionist Larry Eagle. “At a certain point,”says Statman, “we’re just talking, just having a three-way conversation.” This “conversation” changes each time they take the stage, with no melody sounding quite the same as it did before. A totally un-self conscious performer, Andy Statman leaves audiences elated and at times mystified, having experienced a musical performance unlike any other.
In addition to the Andy Statman Trio, Jim Whitney appears in many musical worlds as a bassist. He is an original member of the jazz-bluegrass fusion group The Wayfaring Strangers, and has performed with such acting stars as Meryl Streep, John Goodman and Philip Seymour Hoffman as a member of the group Parabola, under the direction of composer/conductor Carter Burwell. He has appeared with jazz notables Anthony Braxton, Bill Frisell and Alan Dawson, and has worked with bluegrass luminaries Richard Greene, Tim O’Brien, David Grisman and Darol Anger. Also a proficient electric bass player, he appears in the country-rock group Miller’s Farm, and is a member of singer/pianist Debbie Deane’s soul and groove trio. Jim has toured extensively, having performed in Europe, Japan, Singapore, Israel, Central America, New Zealand, Canada, and much of the U.S.
Drummer and percussionist Larry Eagle keeps his musical portfolio diversified.  He’s a founding member of Bruce Springsteen’s Sessions Band (which won a Grammy for traditional folk music), and played on R&amp;B/Soul artist John Legend’s Grammy-winning second album.  He’s played on a Blues Grammy nominee (with Odetta), a Country &amp; Western Grammy nominee (with Andy) and recorded albums with bluegrass superstar Ricky Skaggs and powerful jazz/soul singer Lizz Wright.  Larry has performed on The Tonight Show, Late Night with Conan O’Brien, Good Morning America, PBS, the BBC and an ice-breaking Baltic Sea ferry out of Naantali, Finland.With a career that spans over three decades, John Hammond is one of handful of white blues musicians who was on the scene at the beginning of the first blues renaissance of the mid-’60s. That revival, brought on by renewed interest in folk music around the U.S., brought about career boosts for many of the great classic blues players, including Mississippi John Hurt, Rev. Gary Davis, and Skip James. Some critics have described Hammond as a white Robert Johnson, and Hammond does justice to classic blues by combining powerful guitar and harmonica playing with expressive vocals and a dignified stage presence.
Within the first decade of his career as a performer, Hammond began crafting a niche for himself that is completely his own: the solo guitar man, harmonica slung in a rack around his neck, reinterpreting classic blues songs from the 1930s, ’40s, and ’50s. Yet, as several of his mid-’90s recordings for the Pointblank label demonstrate, he’s also a capable bandleader who plays wonderful electric guitar.
Born November 13, 1942, in New York City, the son of the famous Columbia Records talent scout John Hammond, Sr., what most people don’t know is that Hammond didn’t grow up with his father. His parents split when he was young, and he would see his father several times a year. He first began playing guitar while attending a private high school, and he was particularly fascinated with slide guitar technique. He saw his idol, Jimmy Reed, perform at New York’s Apollo Theater, and he’s never been the same since.
After attending Antioch College in Ohio on a scholarship for a year, he left to pursue a career as a blues musician. By 1962, with the folk revival starting to heat up, Hammond had attracted a following in the coffeehouse circuit, performing in the tradition of the classic country blues singers he loved so much. By the time he was just 20 years old, he had been interviewed for The New York Times before one of his East Coast festival performances, and he was a certified national act.
When Hammond was living in the Village in 1966, a young Jimi Hendrix came through town, looking for work. Hammond offered to put a band together for the guitarist, and got the group work at the Cafe Au Go Go. By that point, the coffeehouses were falling out of favor, and instead the bars and electric guitars were coming in with folk-rock. Hendrix was approached there by Chas Chandler, who took him to England to record. Hammond recalls telling the young Hendrix to take Chandler up on his offer. “The next time I saw him, about a year later, he was a big star in Europe,” Hammond recalled in a 1990 interview.
In the late ’60s and early ’70s, Hammond continued his work with electric blues ensembles, recording with people like Band guitarist Robbie Robertson (and other members of the Band when they were still known as Levon Helm &amp; the Hawks), Duane Allman, Dr. John, harmonica wiz Charlie Musselwhite, Michael Bloomfield, and David Bromberg.
Hammond’s self-titled debut for the Vanguard label has now been reissued on compact disc by the company’s new owners, The Welk Music Group. Other good recordings to check out (on vinyl and/or compact disc) include “I Can Tell” (recorded with Bill Wyman from the Rolling Stones), “Southern Fried” (1968), “Source Point” (1970, Columbia), and his most recent string of early- and mid-’90s albums for Pointblank/Virgin Records, “Got Love If You Want It”, “Trouble No More” (both produced by J.J. Cale), and “Found True Love”.
He didn’t know it when he was 20, and he may not realize it now, but Hammond deserves special commendation for keeping many of the classic blues songs alive. When fans see Hammond perform them, the fans often want to go back further, and find out who did the original versions of the songs Hammond now plays. Although he’s a multi-dimensional artist, one thing Hammond has never professed to be is a songwriter. In the early years of his career, it was more important to him that he bring the art form to a wider audience by performing classic — in some cases forgotten — songs. Now, more than 30 years later, Hammond continues to do this, touring all over the U.S., Canada, and Europe from his base in northern New Jersey. He has continued to release albums into the new millennium with three discs on the Back Porch label, including “Ready for Love” in 2002, produced David Hidalgo of Los Lobos, “In Your Arms Again” in 2005, and “Push Comes to Shove” in 2007.
His latest release, “Rough &amp; Tough,” has wasted no time and reached 13 on the Billboard Blues charts. “This recording is not unlike a live show that I would do except that there was no live audience to perform for,” says Hammond. “It’s been a while since I’ve had a solo album out, so I’m very happy with it. In some ways, “Rough &amp; Tough”, 2harkens back to the first recording Hammond did with Vanguard Records nearly 50 years ago. But over time, Hammond has become a force of nature onto himself, closer in spirit to the icons he emulated as a young man. His guitar playing has become stronger, his expression deepened by the years.
Whether it’s with a band or by himself, Hammond can do it all. Seeing him perform live, one still gets the sense that some of the best is still to come from this energetic bluesman.

     ABOUT THE SHOW:
Youth Company Chicago presents Disney&#39;s Aladdin! All of your favorite characters come to life in this stage adaptation of the hit animated film. Filled with magic, adventure, mayhem, and flying carpet rides!
Follow the exciting journey of the common &#34;street urchin&#34; Aladdin as he tries to win the heart of Princess Jasmine (and her father, the Sultan).  Other favorite characters include the hilarious, wise-cracking Genie (made famous by Robin Williams in the movie), evil Jafar and his bumbling sidekicks, Jafar&#39;s colorful and verbose parrot, Iago, and even the flying carpet - who, in our production, has a starring role.
Most of all, the tuneful, Academy award-winning score with songs including “A Whole New World,” “Prince Ali,” and “Friend Like Me” will certainly make this musical a favorite for many years to come! 
Join us as we transform our new home (5340 West Lawrence Avenue) from a studio into a &#34;whole new world,&#34; with beautiful cultural elements of a far-away time and place.
Your generous purchase of show tickets support our youth programs, including our substantial financial aid program.  Our young artists appreciate your support!

ABOUT THE PERFORMERS:
Aladdin is presented as the culmination of a 5-week intensive summer music theatre program, where students learn skills in acting, movement and vocal production.  The show includes professionally-designed costumes, scenery, props and lighting, as well as a live orchestra.  Best of all, our young actors play the lead and supporting roles - proving our belief that kids can command their own audiences!Don Giovanni is the operatic version of the classic, Don Juan. It tells the story of a pompous womanizer who rapes, seduces, or even marries (and then promptly leaves) ladies so that he can add more names to the list of women he has slept with. He also has a habit to murder their fathers and break up other married couples. Upset by his actions, Donna Elvira, Donna Anna and her fiance Don Ottavio seek out Giovanni to stop him and punish him for his crimes. They find him seducing a bride on her wedding day, but Don Giovanni’s extraordinary skills of deception keep their revenge at bay until the ghost of Anna’s murdered father comes and drags Giovanni to hell.The Experience withrebecca ferguson

Greg Spero is an American jazz pianist based in Chicago, IL. As an award-winning jazz musician and composer, Spero is recognized mainly for modern Jazz, as well as jazz fusion, and for his accomplishments in instrumental hip-hop and electronic music. He has performed with acclaimed musicians such as Arturo Sandoval, Corey Wilkes, and Robert Irving III, co-produced tracks with Ski Beatz and Shock G, produced for pop and hip-hop artists such as Murs and Mos Def, written music scores for movie and theater productions in Chicago, and recorded on worldwide best selling jazz albums. In 2010, Spero was nominated for the title of &#34;Best Jazz Album&#34; at the Chicago Music Awards. The young musician’s complex and developed discography is more reminiscent of that of a performer twice his age, which has helped earn Spero recognition as one of the premiere up-and-coming pianists out of Chicago.
In early 2012, Spero was asked to join the rhythm section of the Buddy Rich Big Band as their regular pianist. Since then, he has had the opportunity to tour with the band, most recently to the United Kingdom, where the band headlined for the “Buddy Rich 25th Memorial Concert” in London. Spero&#39;s trio recently returned from a tour of Europe celebrating their recent CD release, &#34;Acoustic&#34;, which has received radioplay on most major US jazz stations, and many stations in Europe.You&#39;re invited to an intimate, uplifting and music-filled house concert with Bev Barnett &amp; Greg Newlon. Kim-Char Meredith  kicks off the program with a 25 minute set, and then Bev &amp; Greg take the helm with good music that... well, makes you feel good! 
It promises to be a great night of original, indie music. SPACE is LIMITED, and registration is required. Once you register, the week of the show you will receive an email with the exact address and directions (near Washington &amp; 75th). This house concert happens in the beautiful home of our gracious hosts, Tom &amp; Marge Schneider (many of you perhaps fondly remember the last house concert hosted by Tom &amp; Marge, with the talented Sharon Bousquet)? 
Please note: While the registration here online is free, there is a suggested donation of $12-$15 (sliding scale) at the door. A basket will be set out that evening, and you are asked to bless and support our visiting singer/songwriters. 
About the Artists:
Jumping the lines between acoustic soul and folk rock, Bev Barnett &amp; Greg Newlon combine varied musical pasts to create a place where you can relax in the comfort of the groove - knowing you’ll leave smiling and little more hopeful. The first thing you’ll notice is the blend of their harmonies, along with rhythmic guitar that drives a compelling tension and release. Greg’s guitar pushes - Bev’s voice pulls - together exploring life, love and the pursuit of something real. http://www.bevandgreg.com
“I am convinced that whether on disc or live, no one can express sheer joy and happiness better than Kim-Char Meredith-- and I&#39;m also convinced that she makes eye contact with EVERYONE in the audience! Her voice is undeniably sweet, but like the other women of rock &#39;n&#39; roll, she can belt... In person, she is just as captivating as her music” – Jedryan.com (Concert Review, C-Note, NYC)   http://www.kim-char.com

Residing in Los Angeles yet living in a twisted world of sound, this young artist stays dosed to the eyelids in chopped-up samples, meticulously tweaked beats and obese waves of bass.Sugarpill seamlessly merges his techy sensibility and immaculate production skills without ever losing the inherent sexiness of the beats, and this multidimensional musical approach unites EDM fans across a vast spectrum of genres. His original tracks combined with explosive live sets confirm for the producer a powerful spot at the forefront of West Coast future sound. Crossing genres effortlessly and employing a rich variety of styles, his lively and intense sound is best described as a party- and that is exactly what Sugarpill brings to the dance floor.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

http://www.facebook.com/ChrisBsound
------------Over the last two years, the original sounds of Los Angeles-based producer ChrisB. have taken the underground electronic music scene by storm. Drawn to music at an early age, Chris always had an instrument in his hands while embracing everything from hip-hop and funk, to jazz and classic rock. His passion for songwriting lead him to playing guitar in bands throughout his formative years, but it wasn’t until being exposed to the cutting-edge sounds of electronic music that he realized his true creative calling.Always eager to push himself, this charismatic producer spends countless hours in the studio sharpening his own production skills, where his notoriously deep and sensual soundscapes take over the dance floor. But don’t get it twisted, it’s not all chocolates and silk panties. Armed with a voracious appetite for exploring new sounds, ChrisB. can set any party off with his glitchy, crunk-heavy beats and hard-hitting 808‘s. Always striving to strike the perfect balance in his live sets, ChrisB. takes listeners on a psychedelic journey of beautiful melodies and driving bass.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(773) 252-6179Our Cabernet Cabaret performers are ready to tackle the challenge of creating a fabulous finale for our 2012 concert season. Male artists will take on songs made famous by female artists, and female artists will rock some tunes originally sung by male artists.  This eclectic mix of music is sure to entertain…and at the night’s end, our audience decides which of the sexes won the battle!Enjoy refreshments while you learn about PianoForte&#39;s upcoming season--and then be treated to a recital by twin sisters Christina &amp; Michelle Naughton!  We&#39;ve had our eyes on them since they last played here 5 years ago as teenagers, in a breathtaking display of artistic symbiosis. They&#39;ve since gone on to establish significant international careers, and we&#39;re thrilled to bring them back to the PianoForte stage!
Season Preview begins at 6:30 pm; Performance begins at 7:00 pm.  Refreshments offered throughout.

Christina and Michelle Naughton have been hailed by the San Francisco Examiner for their “stellar musicianship, technical mastery, and awe-inspiring artistry.” The Naughtons made their European debut at Herkulesaal in Munich, where the Sueddeutsche Zeitung proclaimed them “an outstanding piano duo”. They made their Asian debut with the Hong Kong Philharmonic, where the Sing Tao Daily said of their performance &#34;Joining two hearts and four hands at two grand pianos, the Naughton sisters created an electrifying and moving musical performance.&#34; An appearance with the Philadelphia Orchestra led the Philadelphia Inquirer to characterize their playing as “paired to perfection,”while the Saarbrücker Zeitung exclaimed “this double star could soon prove to be a supernova.”Tomato Battle for more information.
What to expect:
- 300,000+ tomatoes and thousands of people to throw them!

In 1987, the pedagogical institute in Weingarten, Germany awarded a scholarship for a one-year exchange program at the University of Alabama to one of their students, jazz pianist Monika Herzig. Together with her partner and guitarist Peter Kienle, she arrived in the States on a one-way ticket, with one suitcase of belongings and one guitar in August 1988.
Since then she has completed her Doctorate in Music Education and Jazz Studies at Indiana University, where she is now a faculty member. Her book &#34;David Baker – A Legacy in Music&#34; was released November 2011 on IU Press. As a touring jazz artist, she has performed at many prestigious jazz clubs and festivals, such as the Indy Jazz Fest, Cleveland&#39;s Nighttown, Louisville&#39;s Jazz Factory, the W.C.Handy Festival, Jazz in July in Bloomington and Cincinnati, Columbus&#39; Jazz &amp; Rib Fest, to name just a few. Groups under her leadership have toured Germany, Italy, Japan, opened for acts such as Tower of Power, Sting, the Dixie Dregs, Yes, and more.
Distinctive originals and well-chosen standards reveal Herzig&#39;s warmhearted, reflective side and her cleverly playful nature.

      -John W. Patterson, AAJ Fusion/ Progressive EditorElectronic Sound + Art Chicago launches with a 2 room multimedia event fundraiser at the venerable Viaduct Theater, featuring CHICAGO/MIDWEST DEBUT performances from two legendary electronic music composers, as well performances curated from a selection of established local artists:  • ATOM™(Atom Heart, Señor Coconut) &amp; TOBIAS *CHICAGO/MIDWEST PERFORMANCE DEBUT* [live - From Santiago de Chile &amp; Berlin, DE]...  • CHRIS WIDMAN vs DJ STRIZ [debut tag team set]  • DJ WARP vs FRANKIE VEGA [debut tag team set]  • RADIUS [lagos, beyond luck]  • TIME NICE [dubscription.com]  -&gt; more TBA  ++++++++++++++++++++++ ADVANCE TICKETS via RESIDENT ADVISOR: Presale tickets available at: http://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?389044 
  ++++++++++++++++++++++ Featured Performance Primer:  ATOM™ (Uwe Schmidt) Atom Heart, Señor Coconut From Santiago de Chile &amp; Frankfort, DE  TOBIAS. (Tobias Freund) Monikers: Metazone, Phobia, Pink Elln From Berlin, DE --------------------------------------------- Atom™ and Tobias Freund are veritable living legends of electronic music. Tobias began his career in the early &#39;80s, mainly using the pseudonym &#34;Pink Elln&#34;. He looks back on a long sequence of music making that has led him from mainstream pop to club music, and then onto the experimental and undefinable. Uwe Schmidt, better known as Atom™, has a similar musical background. He is most well known for his work under the Senor Coconut moniker, but has worked under dozens of other aliases, all with their own sound.  Atom™ and Tobias met around 1986, while both were still living in Frankfurt. The pre-techno scene was blossoming when they met in a studio. In 1990, Tobias was the engineer who helped mix and record Atom™&#39;s first release ever. As a natural consequence, Tobias and Atom™ started to work together. Strangely, they collaborated not so much in a studio environment, but mostly playing improvised electronic music concerts. In 1992 they recorded one of the very first live techno recordings ever, the 12-inch &#34;Elektroniikkaa&#34;, which soon became an underground anthem.  Their paths would separate in the &#39;90s - Atom™ moving to Santiago de Chile; Tobias relocating to Berlin - but would reconnect on a live stage again in 2003 at Mutek Chile. Even with a 10 year performance separation, the reactivation worked perfectly and they decided to share the stage more often. They have been playing many concerts worldwide since the successful re-launch in 2003 (Berghain, The Bunker, Labyrinth), and we are excited to have their debut Midwest appearance coincide with the ESAC launch event!    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ABOUT ELECTRONIC SOUND + ART CHICAGO: Electronic Sound + Art Chicago (ESAC) is a new civic-minded electronic music education initiative and creativity cultivator. With the goals of highlighting artistic creativity in electronic music and nurturing talent from the greater Chicagoland area, ESAC is backed by a wealth of over 40 years of experience in innovative musical programming and event production for and throughout the City of Chicago.COAST 2 COAST DJS INDUSTRY MIXER

The rest of the night will feature some of the midwest’s hottest soul DJ’s spinning Northern Soul and Motown classics – Dave Monroe of The Soul Hole in Milwaukee, Jason Berry of Windy City Soul Club, and more!
When it rains, it pours. Recently, Share Your Soles has been dealing with some difficult hurdles, including Founder Mona Purdy’s home being destroyed in a fire and the sudden notice that a new location needed to be found. Most recently, a wonderful group came forward and is lending space so that Mona can carry on her mission, but there is still plenty of work and funds needed in order to keep the momentum going.  
Join us for an evening of soul music and awesome raffle prizes and silent auction items. Looking to donate merchandise? Contact Annie West at 773.653.9378

Crystal Bowls &amp; Sound Healing with Oneness Blessing
By Yolanda LozanoThrough Sound Healing we open our spiritual portals and connect with our mind, body and soul to support our integration of the Light.Awakening is happening for many people right now because the energies are aligning precisely and increased support is available to create a mass shift in consciousness. The Oneness Blessing helps descend this pure life source energy and bring people into the awakened state. With the Oneness Blessing, we transmit energy to family, community, the government and the planet. Shifting our personal vibratory frequency clears the chakras and creates alignment within our physical body and our etheric energy center.  Using our breath and voice to clear energy transmits long distance energy to family, community, the governmentand the planetary systems.

In their early days, Chicago&#39;s alternative rock stars were drawn to the neighborhood around Wrigley Field, the home of the Chicago Cubs, to live and play music. Believe it or not, the gentrification of the neighborhood, the skyrocketing popularity of the Cubs during the 1980s, and the birth of the Smashing Pumpkins are all linked. 
Until a community of artists planted roots around Wrigley Field, it was a largely ethnic neighborhood of working-class families. As more artists moved in, more music venues opened. When young urban professionals joined the ranks, the neighborhood was transformed into &#34;Wrigleyville,&#34; the bustling metro area you see today. 
This tour explores the history of the neighborhood from a unique vantage point, and gives you a taste of Chicago&#39;s finest treasures along the way:

► Walk the perimeter of Wrigley Field and check out the legendary watering holes, rooftop bleachers, and enchanted history that make it so unique


► Visit past and present music clubs where Bob Marley, Prince, REM, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, and Pearl Jam played


► Ride the elevated subway system known as The &#34;L&#34; between the two stations that link the original rock and baseball worlds


► Visit the best souvenir shops for rock and Cubs memorabilia


► Check out the famous 50-year-old bar named Best Rock Club in Chicago, #1 Neighborhood Bar by Maxim magazine, and 7th Best Sports Bar in the U.S. by Sports Illustrated

Meet us at the Belmont &#34;L&#34; station  next to the Never Mind store window on Belmont Avenue. We&#39;ll gather at about 12:45 pm and begin the tour promptly at 1 pm. Bring a CTA subway pass or $2.25/person for fare. KOSHA DILLZ

Artist Round Table Discussion
MusicTuesday September 18, 2012 at 6PM150 N Michigan Avenue Suite 200Free312-263-0472
Artists and curators discuss their work in the field of sound installation, and in particular how their musical practice translates into an architectural form in public space. These artists&#39; musical practice is very often an experience that relates their own bodies to an instrument or system, which then reaches an audience present and in real time. How do they translate these immediate corporeal/musical interests into sound installation, a mediated form that uses recorded sound rather than live sound, and creates an architectural experience for an audience that is often ambient and ambulatory?
 
Michael Thieke (Berlin) is a clarinetist and composer who has been exploring the intricacies and subtleties of his instrument in a number of musical contexts in collaborative and solo situations. Working primarily in the context of rigorous improvisation, he is extremely active with numerous CD releases, concerts, and other projects. Most recently his investigations have expanded into the realm of installations in which the the instrument is expanded into space through multichannel playback.
 
Coppice (Noè Cuellar and Joseph Kramer) (Chicago) is is a Chicago-based duet of musicians and sound artists who use bellows and electronics. Since its formation in 2009 Coppice has produced original compositions for stage, fixed media, and performed installation settings, often focusing on decentralized presentation modes, such as multichannel playback, distributing performers throughout a space, etc. Coppice has appeared at a number of US venues and festivals, including the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, and internationally in Iceland, Sweden and the Netherlands.
 
Ethan Rose (Portland/Chicago) is a sound artist and composer who utilizes methods of interactive composition to explore qualities of materiality, transformation, and perceptual experience through processes of reduction and repositioning. In his performances, installations, film scores, and recorded compositions, Rose’s practice often addresses the position of sound and music within the larger intersections of worldly experience. By inviting a visibly embodied presence into his works, he creates immersive, multi-sensory experiences that expand out from a notion of the purely sonic.
 
Amelia Ishmael (Chicago) is an artist whose practice includes critiquing, historicising, teaching, and curating other artists’ practices. Her areas of specialization include light and sound waves and their intersections in contemporary art. Her recent projects include curating the traveling art exhibition ”Black Thorns in the White Cube,” and serving as co-editor and curator of pages for Helvete, a journal of Black Metal theory. She is currently contributing a column on art and music to Art21.com, and her writings have previously appeared in WIRE, ArtSlant Chicago, Art in Print, and Art Papers. She received a BFA in Photography and New Media from the Kansas City Art Institute and a MA in Modern Art History, Theory, and Criticism from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Moderator: Lou Mallozzi (Chicago) is an artist, curator, and educator. He is co-founder and executive director of Experimental Sound Studio, a nonprofit sonic arts organization, where he has organized concerts, exhibitions, festivals, radio broadcasts, and other cultural programs, presenting the work of over 500 artists in the past 25 years. His own art practice in the realm of sound includes installations, performances, improvised music, radio works, and sound design for cinema, which he has presented widely in the US and Europe. He is adjunct full professor in the Sound Department of The School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Featuring a performance by Boom Shakalaka
M-Pact, Saturday, September 22 at 7 pm The smooth soul of Stevie Wonder, the percussive power of Stomp, the funk and drive of Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire, the hip licks of Take 6, and the brass bite of the Harry Connick Jr.
Hailed &#34;one of the best pop-jazz vocal groups in the world&#34; by the San Francisco Chronicle, m-pact is respected worldwide as a cutting edge trailblazer in the realm of vocal music. Emerging from an age of auto-tune and overproduction, this Los Angeles-based sextet has cultivated a new generation of ears hungry for the fresh, raw power of nature&#39;s &#34;first instrument&#34; - the human voice.
From the beginning, the &#34;pact&#34; of these well-studied masters has been to stay true to Music, regardless of style or genre. Their sophisticated sound and accessible appeal have garnered vast accolades, including &#34;Vocal Group of the Year&#34; from the LA Music Awards, an Indie nomination (the Independent GrammyTM), &#34;Artist of the Year&#34; (Seattle Music Awards), and Grand National Champs of the Harmony Sweepstakes competition.Touring renowned fine arts halls and jazz festivals across four continents, m-pact has performed with pop superstars Sheryl Crow, Boyz II Men, Kenny G, Liza Minnelli, Babyface, Rick Springfield and Jackson Browne to name a few, as well as with jazz legends from Ray Charles, Natalie Cole, Bobby McFerrin, Take 6, and the New York Voices to the Woody Herman Orchestra and the Maynard Ferguson Big Band. Over the last dozen years, their signature sound has been used in both TV themes and animated Disney feature films, and is enjoyed on syndicated radio worldwide.Around the globe, mesmerized audiences buzz from the thrill of m-pact&#39;s vocal acrobatics, innovative orchestrations, and commanding yet authentic stage presence. Unknowing ears of all ages come expecting entertainment but leave enriched from an indescribable experience: the musical journey across Technicolor soundscapes produced by this &#34;Cirque du Soleil of Song&#34;.

ProRhythms is a music-based process that combines mindfulness practices, rhythmic breathing, progressive relaxation, guided imagery and other practices that have been scientifically provoven to promote health and wellbeing.
A ProRhythms Leader guides participants through a specially designed program that allows for self-expression, stress reduction, community building, cooperation, sharing, peer support. Typical sessions last from fourtyfive minutes to one hour.
Research shows that ProRhythms experiences can help to lower anxiety, improve mood, increase empathy and appreciation of others, reduce interpersonal tension, develop trusting relationships, strengthen bonds, and foster a sense of wellbeing.

Designed by master musician, educator, and board-certified music therapist, Kalani Das MT-BC, ProRhythms combines evidence-based experiences into a powerful and dynamic process for individuals and groups.
ProRhythms is a flexible approach to delivering prosocial programs to a variety of populations with varying goals. Some of these include:

Teens - in foster care or who are &#39;at-risk.&#39;
Adults - in working relationships or ongoing support groups.
Older adults - in long-term care facilities.

Goals of ProRhythms groups can include:

Reducing stress-related anxiety, fatigue, and burnout. 
Elevating mood and lifting spirits.
Reducing interpersonal conflict in the workplace or between communities. 
Increasing empathy and peer support.
Reducing bullying and maladaptive behaviors. 
Improving attitudes towards school and classmates.

What is needed to present a ProRhythms program?
All that is needed is a suitable space for a group of up to 20 people. The environment must be music-friendly, meaning that there are no issues with sound affecting those in nearby spaces. Armless chairs are needed for each participant. The session leader provides all the necessary instruments and materials.
Who can become a ProRhythms Leader?
Anyone with a passion for helping others and who enjoys musical experiences. You do not have to be able to sing or play melodies or chords on an instrument, but you do need to be able to keep a steady beat on a drum and be comfortable with public speaking. A background as a teacher, therapist, presenter or facilitator is a plus. ProRhythms is especially suited for those in healthcare professions, such as social workers, caregivers, therapists, councilors; those in educational professions; and those in recreational fields, such as activity leaders, therapeutic musicians, life coaches, and facilitators.
How do I become a Certified ProRhythms Leader?
Attend a ProRhythms Training Program and complete the certification process. Programs take place throughout the year and will be listed on this website. All participants are required to complete a post-training exam to become certified. There is a certification fee of $150 in addition to the course fee of $500. Those attending ProRhythms as part of any DCM course only need to complete the ProRhythms certification process ($150).Upon passing the post-test, candidates become certified and are able to use ProRhythms in any setting their general qualifications allow.
Where can I use ProRhythms?
ProRhythms can be used in just about any setting, from schools to healthcare facilitates. ProRhythms may be added to existing treatment programs or used as a stand-alone service. Certification in ProRhythms does not qualify someone to work in educational, healthcare, or therapy settings, although this type of work may be possible under the supervision of a qualified professional. All applications of ProRhythms are considered to be recreational unless the qualifications of the Leader allow him/her to provide specialized services, in which case it is his/her professional credentials and qualifications that will determine the type of service being offered. For example; a social worker or councilor may use ProRhythms to supplement and expand his/her existing programs. Someone who is not a licensed social worker or councilor, could present ProRhythms sessions under the supervision of a social worker or councilor. In this sense, ProRhythms can be used in just about any setting.

ProRhythms may be helpful for people in:

Cancer/Recovery Support Groups.
Addition Recovery Support Groups.
Domestic Violence and Abuse Support Groups.
Vetrans Support Groups.
After- and In-School Programs.
Senior Centers and Community Centers.
Women&#39;s and Men&#39;s Groups.
GLTB Support Groups.
Retreats, Workshops and Seminars.
Business Development Programs.

ProRhythms is for any group of people who wish to improve their mood, find creative ways to express what words alone cannot, support one another and develop a greater sense of community. Join the ProRhythms community of Certified Leaders and start changing lives. It all begins with you!
October 13-14, 1-5 PM each day.

All payments are final and non-refunable. In the unlikely event that this course is cancelled, all fees will be refunded. Tickets to this course are transferable. Contact Kalani Music for accomodation suggestions.

about Worldwide Orphans Foundation     www.wwo.org
 
Mission: To transform the lives of orphaned children and help them to become healthy, independent, productive members of their communities and the world.
Worldwide Orphans Foundation (WWO) was founded in 1997 by Dr. Jane Aronson, a renowned pediatric infectious disease and adoption medicine specialist, who has dedicated her life to working with children. WWO addresses children&#39;s physical and mental health, their education and their ability to plan for and to achieve that is productive and fulfilling in their own countries.
We believe that institutionalized children must be integrated in their own communities and cultures, and to that end, all WWO programs include orphans and children from the local areas. To accomplish this, we take the following steps:

Identify the unique needs of orphaned children in institutional and group settings around the world and address those needs through medical, developmental, psychosocial and educational programs that are respectful of cultural norms in each setting.  
Nurture orphaned children with the love and attention that is every child&#39;s birthright, so they may grow, learn play and, ultimately, lead productive, dignified adult lives.
Encourage strategic partnerships with like-minded organizations, both in-country and internationally, so WWO can extend its reach, use its resources effectively and ensure sustainability.

 
about the Storm Family
 
The Storm Family support the under-privileged and those in need through both financial and resource provisions. Worldwide Orphans is a key foundation for the Storm Family who remain deeply committed to enriching the communities in which we all live.

ALEX CLARE (SF DEBUT)
THE ROYAL CONCEPT (SWEDEN)
 
DJs: AARON AXELSEN AND OMAR
 
ALEX CLARE
You can learn a lot about someone by asking them what they think the greatest record ever made is. Take Alex Clare. Tell him you’re going round to his flat tonight with the express intention of smashing every piece of recorded music he owns – leaving him only one – and the ideas just come tumbling out.
“Wow!” he laughs. “If it was production wise I’d probably go for Radiohead’s OK Computer. It’s an incredible record – kind of mind-blowing really. But it’s not the greatest record ever made…”
Alex stirs his coffee and thinks.
“The first record I ever fell in love with was The Score by The Fugees, but that’s not the greatest record ever made either. I used to think it was The White Album – but it’s not that… I suppose it might be Donny Hathaway’s second album, the one with Magnificent Sanctuary Band on? But I think, really, it’s Stevie Wonder’s Songs In The Key Of Life. That track Have A Talk With God has the most incredible synth parts you’ve ever heard. That’s the greatest record ever made for me.”
He sits back – pleasurably exhausted.
“You can’t touch Stevie,” he says. “Even his bad ones are amazing!”
Alex Clare is just the sort of musician you’re glad is still being made in the country’s basements, backrooms and bedrooms. Born and bred in South East London and raised on his dad’s bebop records, as a child Alex toyed with the trumpet before taking up the drums to help him get rid of all his nervous energy.

CHROMATICS
Chromatics are the reflection on the dark side of the street. With Night Drive, they were barely there but they seemed to weigh a ton. Beautiful vocals giving life to city phrases, rhythms that keep everyone moving but not quickly enough to miss the crash. There are times when you can’t listen anymore to them because it hurts too much, and then you press play again. There’s an intimate distance to their music, with just enough separation that you don’t really know what’s going on.

Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde
Bizarre Ride Live is the visually vibrant, aurally astounding, and truly one-of-a-kind tribute to the classic hip-hop album Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde.  Playing The Pharcyde’s seminal debut in its entirety, from start to finish, former members Fatlip and SlimKid3 have re-joined forces with Bizarre Ride producers J-Sw!ft and L.A. Jay to create this unique spectacular. Blurring the lines between a straight up hip-hop show and a theatrical performance, Bizarre Ride Live includes all the original skits and interludes from the record, and even some special surprise guests (“did somebody page Quinton??”). No details are missed out as renowned graffiti artist SLICK, who designed the albums iconic cover, art-directs the stage and live audio-visuals are taken care of by L.A. Jay. Expect animated hip-hop, energetic raps, bright colors, b-boy throw-downs, magnetic visuals, a heavy dose of humour, and absolutely everything in between.  Fatlip: Originally the dancer and lyricist Jammer D, Fatlip became hip-hop’s most treasured under-dog as an MC in The Pharcyde. His 2005 solo album The Loneliest Punk became an underground classic, and he is currently touring the world with his DJ Fatlip brand.  SlimKid3: The ever soulful SlimKid3 always brought a poetic edge to The Pharcyde, and in his blossoming solo career has released two beautiful albums, Liberation and SlimKid3’s Cafe. Now based in Portland he runs the popular hip-hop night Live and Direct PDX.  J-Sw!ft: The musical genius behind Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde’s stunning, jazz-drenched soundscape, J-Sw!ft has produced masterpieces for The Pharcyde and The Wascals, and is to bring out his solo project “The Adventures of Negro Kanevil” this year.  L.A. Jay: Stemming from a musical family background, L.A. Jay produced his first major label record for The Good Girls, All for Your Love, on Motown in 1989. Since, he has produced and remixed many stellar tracks for DV acts such as the Pharcyde and Masta Ace.

About Slide: Back in the Prohibition Era of San Francisco, 430 Mason Street was a space called the Cable Car Theater. Below the theater was a restaurant called Cafe Dans. In actuality, cafe Dans was not a restaurant, but a speakeasy that could be accessed only by a savvy few that would push a secret wall, leading you to a playground slide. This slide would take you below the street level where one could indulge in illicit gambling and the drinking of bootleg whiskey and spirits. In an era of secret codes and handshakes, the speakeasy was a hidden subculture of nightlife. Old world San Francisco elegance has been reborn. Slide is modern and sophisticated but is also reminiscent of the age of gangsters, flappers and bootleg revelry of years past.Pink Mammoth and Bassyx are back for round # 5 of BADA BIG BOOM!!! For this very special occasion we are pleased to bring back two very special headliner Djs -
Doc Martin (Homebass, LA)Colette (OM, Candy Talk, APT)We&#39;ll have an OPEN BAR of pink Playa punch from 9pm-10:30pm and FREE FOOD from the     Subs On Hubs food truck beginning at 10pm.

Biography
 
Little Bird is part of astounding outpouring of new material from Kasey Chambers. 14 diverse compositions written within two hectic weeks in February 2010, then recorded as a complete album a month later. Due for release on 17th September Little Bird, is the first solo album in 4 years from one of Australia’s most accomplished singer songwriters.
The new album represents the most diverse spread of musical styles of Kasey’s glittering career, which has reaped multiple ARIA and APRA awards, Number One hits and multi-platinum sales in Australia and around the world.
Little Bird the single was released to radio in August 2010 and gained national radio play instantly pushing the boundaries for modern country music by gaining radio play on Major FM networks.
Listen closely and you’ll hear a poignant note behind the sunny, optimistic sound of Little Bird, as Kasey reflects on a young woman’s insecurities.“I started remembering how I felt when I wrote Not Pretty Enough and comparing it to how I feel now. I was wondering how that sentiment would come out if I revisited it,” says Kasey. “I still have moments like that, of feeling insecure and unsure, but I feel differently about that now. I feel stronger and more powerful, not willing to compromise so much.
“This is like the strong, secure version of Pretty Enough.”
Little Bird follows Kasey’s success in 2009 with “Kasey Chambers, Poppa Bill and The Little Hillbillies.” Released in November through Liberation.This project included Kasey’ s first children’s book and joint effort Album with her Dad Bill, which also sees the debut of a new generation of Chambers singer/songwriters. The Little Hillbillies are made up of Kasey’s sons Talon and Arlo, Bill’s further additions, Jake and Tyler, Nash’s tribe of 3, Eden, Skye and Béla and best friend Worm’s son Townes.

BIO- Sarah Jarosz

 

Sarah Jarosz has as rich a skill set as anybody in acoustic music. She plays, not just one instrument, but enough of them to be a one-woman string band: mandolin, octave mandolin, clawhammer banjo and guitar. She sings – in supple tones that transcend the boundaries between folk and pop – and she writes – old-timey ballads and modern singer-songwriter ruminations alike. Raised just outside of Austin in Wimberley, Tex., Jarosz blossomed within the local music scene and well beyond it, earning admirers from Austin City Limits’ Terry Lickona to acoustic music mavens Tim O’Brien and Chris Thile with her mature sensibilities. She released her debut, Song Up In Her Head, on Sugar Hill Records the year she graduated high school. What followed was a move to Boston’s prestigious New England Conservatory, a GRAMMY nomination and performances on “Austin City Limits” and “A Prairie Home Companion” as well as prestigious music festivals – Bonnaroo, Telluride and Newport, to name a few.In May of 2011, Follow Me Down came out, a sophomore album that coincided with the end of her sophomore year of college. It channeled her ever-broadening musical horizons, and again showcased her songwriting, offering two tasty covers and including a number of top-notch guests from Punch Brothers to Shawn Colvin. The album met with critical acclaim - the New York Times called Jarosz “one of acoustic music’s most promising young talents”, and MSN Music named her “one of the fastest-rising stars in the roots music scene”.What followed was a whirlwind tour packed into summer break. Since neither Sarah nor her musicians, Nathaniel Smith (cello) and Alex Hargreaves (violin) were old enough to rent a car, it became the tour of planes, trains and automobiles driven by whoever could be pressed into service. Despite this, Sarah managed to cover a large portion of the United States, make several forays into Canada and two trips to Europe. One of the highlights of her year included participation in the Transatlantic Sessions – a folk collaboration of top musicians from the United States, Ireland, and the UK. This fall, she returned to NEC for her junior year, which will be punctuated by more touring slipped into holiday breaks.Despite her age, Sarah Jarosz maintains a highly developed sense of what she’s about. “What’s most important,” she emphasizes, “is just trying to stay true to myself as an artist and be as original as I can.” Whether it’s continuing her studies at NEC or soaking up inspiration from collaborations with musicians across the globe she’s doing just that.

MILES THE DJ
BT MAGNUM
 
Bag Raider’s long overdue and lovingly anticipated debut self-titled album is finally complete. Now the boys are ready to sit back, kick their feet up and enjoy the sound of jaws collectively dropping across the planet as they deliver one of the most well rounded and unique debut pop albums of the year.Bag Raiders are the combined talents of Jack Glass and Chris Stracey. Together, they produce the sparks of light, aural gems and sonic booms that make up one of the most sought-after up and coming duos on the planet.  After dropping singles on Bang Gang 12s (Fun Punch, Turbo Love) and remixing the likes Cut Copy, Midnight Juggernauts and Kid Sister, the two’s reputation internationally grew, and when they released a little ditty titled ‘Shooting Stars’ they reached every dangerous, dark and smokey corner of the world, making them a household name among in-the-know indie kids, the sweaty dance faithful and the DJs across the globe.A collection of thoughts, ideas and memories, Bag Raiders transcends typical dance and pop boundaries, showcasing the creativity of a band at the forefront of modern production.  The album ticks the right boxes for fans new and old, coming correct with sing-a-long choruses, deep-breath anthems, blissful chill and pure dancefloor energy. In short Bag Raiders debut album adds a new dimension in the cluttered and diluted dance world.

CON BRIO
DJ Señor Oz (Afrolicious)
Particle is an American jam band formed in Los Angeles in 2000. The original members were Dave Simmons (guitar), Steve Molitz (keyboard), Eric Gould (bass), and Darren Pujalet (drums). Simmons died shortly after the formation of the band due to a sudden illness. Guitarist Charlie Hitchcock joined shortly thereafter. Along with The Disco Biscuits and Sound Tribe Sector 9, the group was among the first to blend rock, jazz, funk, and electronica into the milieu of what has been dubbed livetronica (a subgenre of the jam band movement where live bands blend the structures of DJ-produced sequenced electronic music into a more traditional live band setting). Prior to 2006, the band&#39;s repertoire consisted entirely of instrumental material.
The group made a name for itself and built an enthusiastic fan base, known as Particle People, by performing energetic late-night sets at festivals such as Bonnaroo. Reliance on word of mouth from fans, rather than advertising, allowed this group to sell out venues such as the Bowery Ballroom in New York City before they finally released their much anticipated first album, Launchpad, in early 2004. In April and May 2005 the group toured with former Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart as Hydra; the tour received mixed reviews from many Deadheads who were unaccustomed to Particle&#39;s electronic-based approach. Bassist Phil Lesh, also of the Grateful Dead, sat in with the band that summer.

THE VERY BEST
PALNER (URBAN WORLD RECORDS)
SEYE

THE VERY BEST
The Very Best is Malawi&#39;s Esau Mwamwaya and London based producer Johan Hugo (We Don&#39;t Belong in Pacha). By all accounts, the far-flung variables that comprise The Very Best shouldn&#39;t coincide – but then again, how many bands can say they met in an East London (Hackney) junk shop? The chance introduction over the purchase of a bicycle in 2008 led production duo Radioclit to invite Esau Mwamwaya into their studio to collaborate on the mixtape that would launch their career. Containing an infectious cross-pollination of samples and rhythms anchored by Esau&#39;s soaring vocals, the mixtape quickly went viral (with approx. 850,000 downloads to date). Pitchfork offered them a slot at their festival for their U.S. debut, and worldwide tour dates for their infamous live shows followed. 2010 saw the release of the trio&#39;s full length Warm Heart of Africa – featuring Vampire Weekend&#39;s Ezra Koenig and MIA – which led them to share the stage with Florence &amp; the Machine, The xx, Mumford and Sons, and of course Vampire Weekend across Australia, Europe, and Africa. That summer Etienne returned to France (disbanding Radioclit), leaving Johan and Esau in a Swedish cottage laying down tracks that would become the Super Mom mixtape. When it came time for the next album,most of the earlier sessions in NYC were scrapped in favour of what transpired – in true TVB fashion – just last October. Johan flew to Esau&#39;s hometown of Lilongwe, Malawi where they rented a bare bones studio and recorded 9 songs in five weeks. The resulting tracks are their biggest and bravest– and definitely indicative that this project was meant to be, no matter how it came together.

Getting all three disc jockeys together for this event is not an easy task. Capacity for this event will be strictly limited, so make sure to grab your discount presales for this rare and historic event. All 3 Djs will play from 10pm until LATE taking lucky attendees on a music journey  of deep, soulful house music classics old and new. 
Body &amp; Soul was a weekly dance party in New York City that took place every Sunday afternoon. Years ago founders DJ François K and John Davis proposed the idea for a Sunday afternoon party. &#34;The club owners thought they were crazy,&#34; says Joann Davis, part of the Body &amp; Soul crew &#34;but it caught on. Francois-K and John came up with the name Body and Soul, and it fit. House music has always been about feeling it, sharing the vibe together. The spirituality is in the music. It has nothing to do with organized religion.&#34;

SIMIAN MOBILE DISCO - LIVE
MORE TBA

SIMIAN MOBILE DISCO
It’s not hyperbolic bio speak to say that Simian Mobile Disco are one of the most successful electronic music acts around today. It’s verifiable fact.
Funny thing is, though, the duo of James Ford and James Shaw never planned it that way. Instead, it kind of just happened. The boys started the group on a lark, a side-project from their main group in the mid-’00s, Simian. But as the group imploded on a lengthy tour of the United States, the DJ gigs, remixes and mixes that were once a hobby became a full-time gig.
Things have been hectic ever since. Early singles such as “The Mighty Atom,” “The Count” and Kitsuné hit “Hustler” led to a 2007 debut album Attack Decay Sustain Release on Wichita Recordings. The record was their breakthrough, adding tracks like “It’s the Beat,” “Tits and Acid” and “I Believe” to their discography.
Perhaps more importantly, it also gave birth to what would become one of electronic music’s most talked-about live shows, a celebrated DJing career and respect among their peers for a dedication to an analogue production aesthetic. Their highly improvised live set sees them running circles around a complicated modular rig while their trademark light show pulses along in time, constantly treading the line between crowd-pleasing and cerebral.

Popscene &amp; MIGHTY presents 
PENGUIN PRISON DJ SET
w/ Aaron Axelsen Popscene

Even if you never find out what a Penguin Prison is, there’s no denying Chris Glover aka Penguin Prison has made a brilliant record. If you’re a fan of New York disco, as accessible as it is angular, all burbling bass lines, resonant rhythms, shimmering synths and heavenly melodies, then you’ll love the new Penguin Prison album.
Imagine, if you will, Chic produced by James Murphy, or a collaboration between Prince and The Human League. It is some measure of Penguin Prison’s skills in the studio, on vocals and in terms of songwriting, that such illusory marvels have been achieved on this superb self-titled collection, that some critics have gone as far as to hail it a modern day Off The Wall masterpiece.
“It’s not a concept album about Michael,” says Prison, or maybe we should call him Penguin, of his all-time hero “But it’s definitely been influenced by him.”
To say he was an early starter would be an understatement. From the age of 10 he was singing in the local gospel choir. When he was 11, he got an agent and began recording jingles. By 12, he had learned to play guitar and was into punk rock, the American variety – bands such as Green Day, NOFX and Bad Religion. He even performed as a teen at the legendary CBGBs with his band The Museum.
Chris became Penguin Prison at the start of 2009. It wasn’t long before he earned a reputation as remixer du jour for the likes of Marina and the Diamonds, Goldfrapp and Passion Pit. He agrees that he conferred NY kudos especially on the British artists, and admits his favorite remix was for Jamiroquai, adding that the secret to a good remix is “to throw everything away from the original track and start from scratch”.
It was inevitable that Chris would then make music of his own, which he began in late 2009. You can hear the spectacular results on the debut Penguin Prison album, which sounds to all intents and purposes like a Greatest Hits collection, so chock-full it is of catchy hooks and classic pop choruses. There is Multi-Millionaire, which is about “being rich even if you’ve got no money” and one titled Don’t Fuck With My Money that features Jackson-style percussive gasps and a lyric that pushes the envelope. “I was worried it was too crazy – ‘Can I really say that?’ People said leave it in, so I did. “All my lyrics are sarcastic but serious as well,” he adds. “So I’m really saying ‘don’t fuck with my money’! Because if you try to, it’s not going to be good…”TASTEMAKER LIVE AND SEAN HEALY PRESENT
RZA with FULL LIVE BAND

On Thursday, August 16, the leader and architect of the Wu-Tang Clan hip-hop dynasty, the RZA, will take to Mezzanine’s live stage backed by his live band. RZA is a dynamic creative force, a prolific producer and songwriter, composer, MC, author, actor, director and screenwriter. His reach touches numerous creative disciplines blending a Far Eastern martial arts aesthetic with a concrete-bred street based form of New York Hip-Hop. About.com cited him as number three in their list of best hip hop producers of all time. 
Since the Wu-Tang Clan released their debut album &#34;Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&#34; in 1993, RZA has driven the Staten Island (also known as Shaolin) based group and their brand at a frenetic pace developing an industry powerhouse and hip-hop empire. Kris Ex of Rolling Stone called Wu-Tang Clan &#34;the best rap group ever.&#34; A master of aliases, The RZA is also known as the Abbot, or as his alter ego, Bobby Digital, and as a founding member of horrorcore rap group, Tha Gravediggaz, RZA transforms into the RZArector. 
RZA has maintained on iron grip on the production of Wu-Tang albums both as a beatmaker and in a greater sense with ultimate oversight on the direction and aesthetic of each LP. He was as involved in a number of the earlier releases from individual Wu-Tang members, easing his grip in later years. Recently, he has worked with some of the game&#39;s other heavy-hitters including Kanye West, Jay-Z, Nas, Talib Kweli and Busta Rhymes to name a few.
In 2007, RZA wrote the score for the movie &#34;Afro Samurai&#34; starring Samuel L. Jackson. He had a part in the action/adventure movie &#34;Repo Men&#34; starring Jude Law and Forest Whitaker. He has also appeared in a handful of other films including Coffee and Cigarettes, American Gangster, Gospel Hill, Life Is Hot in Cracktown, Ghost Dog and Funny People. This summer RZA has made headlines again with not only news of a tour, but with the announcement that he will be starring and directing a Quentin Tarantino-produced, kung-fu action movie, &#34;Iron Fists&#34; slated for release on Oct. 26, also staring Lucy Lui and Russell Crowe. 
RZA was born in Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York, however, much of his childhood was spent between Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with his father and North Carolina with his uncle. His first stint in Hip-hop started in the late 1980s, when a young RZA and his cousins GZA (then called the Genius) and Ol’ Dirty Bastard (then called Ason Unique, the Specialist, and the Professor) started the rap group, the Force of the Imperial Master which eventually came to be known as the All in Together Now Crew after a single they released by the same name.
Once the group split up, both GZA and RZA sought and landed solo record deals, almost becoming casualties of the music industry. GZA signed with Cold Chillin’ and RZA with Tommy Boy. GZA dropped his LP, Words from the Genius which did not sell well and RZA released the EP, We Love You Rakeem and shortly after found himself in jail, undermining the release. Both artists struggled with creative control during their brief stints at their respective labels and swore they’d master the industry on their own terms. This sequence of events led to the eventual formation of the Wu-Tang Clan with the RZA at the helm.

About Slide: Back in the Prohibition Era of San Francisco, 430 Mason Street was a space called the Cable Car Theater. Below the theater was a restaurant called Cafe Dans. In actuality, cafe Dans was not a restaurant, but a speakeasy that could be accessed only by a savvy few that would push a secret wall, leading you to a playground slide. This slide would take you below the street level where one could indulge in illicit gambling and the drinking of bootleg whiskey and spirits. In an era of secret codes and handshakes, the speakeasy was a hidden subculture of nightlife. Old world San Francisco elegance has been reborn. Slide is modern and sophisticated but is also reminiscent of the age of gangsters, flappers and bootleg revelry of years past.Club Exotica and An-Ten-Nae Present  :: GET FREAKY ::

KOAN Sound http://koansound.com/KOAN Sound is an electronic music act consisting of Will Weeks and Jim Bastow, both hailing from Bristol, UK.The group’s early origins and influences lie mainly in acoustic based music, from bands such as Incubus to RATM, but it wasn’t until 2005 that the duo became immersed in electronic music through acts such as Noisia and The Prodigy. Soon after, the growing Dubstep scene in Bristol began to inform their productions, eventually leading to a string of releases on various labels.In early 2011 KOAN Sound released their first extended single, the ‘Max Out EP’. The release signalled a turning point in their production, gradually moving away from the 140bpm template and showcasing a wider range of styles than before. It also helped bring more attention to the act, and led to working with a number of artists, including singer/songwriter Ed Sheeran.Later in the year the group would unveil their biggest release to date, the ‘Funk Blaster EP’ on Skrillex’s OWSLA imprint. The EP achieved the No. 1 spot in the Beatport releases category, and received exclusive featuring from US-based magazine Rolling Stone.The duo rounded off the year with DJ sets across Europe and North America, and picked up ‘Best Breakthrough Artist’ at the Dubstep Music Awards in November. They will be fresh off their Canadian Train tour with the likes of Skrillex, Pretty Lights, Diplo, Grimes &amp; Tokimonsta and ready to slay San Francisco!

DZ DEATHRAYS 

DJS: OMAR &amp; AARON AXELSEN

TRUST


Trust is Robert Alfons and Maya Postepski.
Formed in 2009, the Toronto-based duo released its first singles, “Candy Walls” and “Bulbform,” on Brooklyn-based Sacred Bones Records in 2011 before signing with Arts &amp; Crafts for the 2012 release of their forthcoming debut full length, TRST.
In the last year they’ve performed with DFA1979, Crystal Castles, Austra, Balam Acab, Glass Candy, and Hercules and Love Affair.
Tales of lust, wax, and erotomania carry along on a dense black vapor of speed, space and tears. Trust is a pop hit factory buried deep in the mud.”

 
DZ DEATHRAYS


Without a doubt, Australian two-piece, DZ Deathrays are one of the most hotly talked about bands of the past year. After signing to Melbourne-based record label I OH YOU in early 2011, they’ve been releasing and touring relentlessly, introducing themselves to the world as one of the most brutal new bands on the scene.
After such an exciting year, one is left wondering – what is this band’s story? Where did they come from?

The Flashbulb
Acousmatic, Tape music, IDM , Classical, Glitch

Born in 1978 and raised in the sketchy Ashburn district of South Chicago, Benn Jordan began playing jazz-influenced guitar before reaching the age of attending school. Without any proper musical training, his awkward style of inverted guitar playing and composition knew few restrictions and eventually panned out into full blown albums recorded on tape machines in his bedroom in the mid 1990’s. Being a one man band, Jordan grew quite fond of electronic instruments, which for a period of a few years dominated his compositions as he gained worldwide notoriety as an avant-garde electronic musician using the name “The Flashbulb”.

Bartel
Electronic, Experimental, Ambient

BARTEL was formed in 2008. May of 2009 marked the release of the debut E.P on Alphabasic Records, Chicago. Bartel’s music has been described as “haunting, yet melodic; down-tempo, yet driving. Swelling ambient soundscapes meet with deep glitch cuts, while a dub sensibility keeps it all sounding like a distant memory.” More to the the point, the Bartel aesthetic explores the intersection between ultra- modern synthesis, location recording, and experimental sound design; encouraging an approach to song writing which is both technical and cinematic.

The exciting and uplifting Hawaiian singer Paula Fuga makes her Ashkenaz debut with her longtime collaborators in the Mike Love Trio. Whether just singing and strumming her ukulele, or backed by the Trio’s full reggae-world beats, Fuga’s unique voice and vision stand out. She combines her lyrics with music rooted in Hawaiian folk tradition, reggae, world, and Polynesian sounds that have brought international attention since the release of her first album, “Lilikoi,” in 2006. More recently Fuga has opened Jack Johnson’s stateside tours, and he and Ziggy Marley sang on her most recent recording: Johnson dueted on the hit “Country Road,” and Marley appeared on a new arrangement of his father Bob Marley’s “High Tide or Low Tide.” Fuga’s latest recording, “Misery’s End,” has received rave reviews, and the title song is one of the highlights of her current concert.
Her longtime musical partner, singer-guitarist Mike Love (of bands such as Dubkonscious), and his Trio are backing her as she performs at festivals from Oregon’s Northwest World Reggae Festival to Southern California’s Doheny Surf Festival. Tonight’s show is a rare chance to see Fuga in a full concert.
Fuga comes from a humble beginning, surrounded by the blues and gospel music of Louisiana, before becoming rooted and matured in the cultural richness and diversity of Hawaii (she lives on the north shore of Oahu) and eventually touring internationally and to both American coasts. Along the way she has chosen to serve as a musical ambassador for her Hawaiian culture. She uses her talent as an instrument to help bring about positive social change within her islands and beyond: performing at benefit concerts for charter schools, instilling the Hawaiian culture in the generations to come, and generally being a beacon of the meditative and healing powers of her people. Fuga is the recipient of a Na Hoku Hano Hano Award, Hawaii’s highest and most prestigious musical honor.
 “My life is a miracle,” Fuga said in an interview for a Hawaiian publication. “I was homeless on the beach by the time I was 5 years old. I lived in a car, in all kinds of weird, crazy situations. But I truly believed that good things would happen to me if I just kept being a good person… I know how miraculous it is for me to be where I am. And this is just the beginning for me; I’m just getting started. And I’m so grateful that Jack (Johnson) likes having me around and sees something in me that’s good. I feel so lucky.”

Join us on August 10th at Monarch (6th + Mission) for round 2 of GAFFTAHours: the Bunker A/V Sessions #2 with Atom™ + Tobias. This audiovisual showcase is the second iteration of a two part series of our collaboration with the New York techno institution, the Bunker. Again, the Bunker has curated the sound artists for the event and GAFFTA will be presenting some of our favorite code-based visual artists, including NYC-based visualists vade and outpt. Find out more about the part 1 of the A/V sessions w/ Voices from the Lake.

Atom™ + Tobias - LIVE
 (Mule/Logistic :: Chile/Berlin)

Atom™ and Tobias Freund are both well known figures in electronic music. In fact, many would argue that they are living legends. Tobias began his career in the early &#39;80s, mainly using the pseudonym &#34;Pink Elln&#34;. He looks back on a long sequence of music making that has led him from mainstream pop to club music, and then onto the experimental and unclassifiable. Uwe Schmidt, better known as Atom™, has a similar musical background. He is most well known for his work under the Senor Coconut moniker, but has worked under dozens of other aliases, all with their own sound. Atom™ and Tobias met around 1986, while both were still living in Frankfurt. The pre-techno scene was blossoming when they met in a studio. In 1990, Tobias was the engineer who helped mix and record Atom™&#39;s first release ever. As a natural consequence, Tobias and Atom™ started to work together. Strangely, they collaborated not so much in a studio environment, but mostly playing improvised electronic music concerts. In 1992 they recorded probably one of the very first live techno recordings ever, the 12-inch &#34;Elektroniikkaa&#34;, which soon became an underground anthem. Even though their paths separated for a while in the &#39;90s, with Atom™ moving to Santiago de Chile and Tobias relocating to Berlin, they reconnected their machines on a live stage again in 2003 at Mutek in Chile. Even though they had stopped working together for almost 10 years, the reactivation worked perfectly and they decided to share the stage more often. They have been playing many concerts worldwide since the successful re-launch in 2003, including appearances at Berghain, The Bunker, and Labyrinth. Their live sets are always completely improvised, both immersing into the unknown territory of the club, the audience and the sound. 
Mike Servito
(Ghostly/Bunker :: NYC)  Mike Servito is from a very special yet temporary and partially lost fertile crescent of techno / house / party DJing. It was a time when raves were still a fresh idea, almost felt like a revolution, and DJs like Claude Young, D Wynn, Derrick Carter and Mike Huckaby were informing an upcoming generation. If you look directly to that inspired generation you will find the lost threads of Detroit Techno, House and beyond, you will find a group of DJs with insanely deep mixing skills, the ability to rock almost any kind of party with an improvisational approach that is so skilled it makes everything seem so well thought out that even they don&#39;t know where their set will go. But, it will take you there! In the future, this special generation of deep midwest mixers will be remembered and revered as the wizards they are, long after the trendy players have lost their luster. Detroit never forgot about Mike Servito, his upfront dirty deep and bitchy taste has had an impact on Detroit nightlife for over a decade. From debuting in 1995 at Dat&#39;s Poorboy parties, to being a resident at blackbx and Ghostly&#39;s Untitled (along with Derek Plaslaiko, Tadd Mullinix, Matthew Dear, and Ryan Elliott), contributing to the bizarrely popular, wild and free Dorkwave, and progressing that concept into Sass (the hippest queer party in Detroit at the time), to blowing minds at Interdimensional Transmissions&#39; No Way Back parties, Servito has made his impression. Moving to Brooklyn, Detroit&#39;s loss has been their gain, as he has found a proper home with a new residency at the Bunker, and worldwide representation from Beyond Booking. 
Carlos Souffront
(Interdimensional Transmissions :: SF)  Carlos Souffront is a music gourmet, a true DJ&#39;s DJ. His taste is rich and vast and he has the unique ability to create deeply rhythmic narratives that offer unexpected and exotic spices. He mastered his deep mixing skills with a cassette deck and a belt drive turntable in his father&#39;s den in Troy, home of contemporaries such as Mike Servito, Tadd Mullinex and Matt Dear. Equally entrenched in indie rock, post punk, experimental music, ambient, rock, house, and techno, Carlos was always a man of many worlds - with an ability to traverse though them with an unique imagination. There is a mood to his search within sound, something that is heavy, deep yet gritty. Like many Caribbean transplants that ends up in northern colder climates, he wonders where our rhythmic complexity is. For him it is effortless and endlessly surprising to the listener. Carlos is an important component of the Interdimensional Transmissions parties, bringing a loose yet tight moody deepness and an ever unexpected edge. At the original No Way Back party, he demanded truth in advertising, pushing us to and then past the 12 hour mark. He has participated in the studio with Ectomorph, and also performed alongside some of their live performances. It is all too rare to find someone within the electronic music spectrum that can be called an original, that you can only really explain to someone who experienced them on the dance floor, usually just by saying &#34;that&#39;s so&#34; and saying their name. Carlos is one of those rarities. 
Jason Kendig
(Honey Soundsystem / Mr. INTL :: SF)  Jason Kendig is a resident DJ at Honey Soundsystem and MR.INTL label co-owner with Andy Butler of Hercules and Love Affair, as well as their guest DJ on recent tours. He&#39;s played with Horse Meat Disco in London and at Club Lux in Lisbon, Tripod in Dublin, Pratersauna and Fluc Wanne in Vienna, Berghain in Berlin and Hafen 2 in Frankfurt. He&#39;s known to bring an extremely wide range old and new school disco, house and techno. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Conor
(No Way Back :: SF)  15 years of collecting records, and performing in discos and parties across the U.S. — including San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles and Miami. Playing alongside luminaries such as Greg Wilson, Mike Huckaby, LCD Soundsystem, Metro Area, !!! (Chk Chk Chk), Maurice Fulton, Lindstrom, Pal Joey, Rub-N-Tug, Bebel Gilberto, Harvey, Trevor Jackson, Virgo Four, Optimo, Theo Parrish, Larry Heard, and Tim Sweeney. Current resident at No Way Back as well as making frequent guest appearances on Jeno’s cult favorite show, Noise From The Void. Released edits for Rong Music and Public Release.

(LUCIANO)     With the release of his landmark CD &#34;Where There Is Life&#34; in 1995, Luciano emerged as one of the most important reggae singers in decades and the greatest hope for roots reggae&#39;s survival in the digital dancehall era. Since that much acclaimed release, Luciano&#39;s music has been consistently praised for imparting sentiments of spiritual salvation, Rastafarian edification and African repatriation.(NATIVE ELEMENTS)      San Francisco&#39;s reggae favorite Native Elements (now in their 10th year as a cohesive unit) never fail to bring positivity and niceness to all of their music gatherings. As recording artist&#39;s they spin a curious fabric of lovers rock, roots and conscious dancehall wrapped cozily in a bright &#34;frisco-pino&#34; treatment. A family before anything else Native Elements strives to make their show a warm and inviting experience for all; young and old, blue and green and everything in between.(INDUBIOUS)Rising up out out of the fertile soil of Southern Oregon&#39;s Rogue Valley, the group of Intergalatic Reggae Revolutionaries known as Indubious come to spread high vibes through their earth-shattering sound. Their sound is an eclectic mix of reggae, dance hall and new roots reggae, visionary lyrical messages and wordplay, 2 and 3 part harmonies, and electro funk fusion jams creating a sound destined to change the face of music.DJ&#39;s:Jah Warrior Shelter:Irie Dole &amp; DJ I-Vier:

Why Participate?
With current and projected future demands on limited global resources, sustainability has evolved from an issue of corporate social responsibility to a business imperative.
Björn Stigson, senior advisor and former President, World Business Council for Sustainable Development   
This is not about having a good reputation, it’s because it’s good for the business. We have a strong belief that a high social performance leads to a high financial performance.
Clara Gaymard, chief executive officer and president, GE France
After social enterprises, social ventures, and social entrepreneurship, the most recent wave toward social and financial convergence are for-profit models emerging around the globe as faster vehicles toward social impact. This wave awakened $400 Billion in impact investing by 2017 (according to JP Morgan), and a tsunami of socially minded professionals, leaders, and innovators seeking to make a living making positive change in the world.
We have Social Impact Bonds, Benefit Corporations, Sustainable Design, Green Tech, Offices of Social Innovation, Occupy, Social and Mobile Technologies, Crowd Sourcing, Collaborative Brands, and many other interrelated forces that seem to be stirring us in the same direction. But how does it all happen? How do we converge?
Figure it out with us%.

FIGURE
Small-town producer Josh Gard has had a long history in music, but lately he has been rapidly rising up the ranks of all things bass. Just a few short years ago he donned the name of Figure and began making electro house, and he has since become a regular name in the realms of dubstep and drumstep. Scoring positions in Beatport’s top ten charts may have gotten him recognition, but a fantastic amount of praise has been raining down on him lately as some of the leading artists in electronic music have valued his live performance skills as some of the best in the business. It’s those kind of endorsements that load up Figure’s tour calendar and make him a moving target that’s hard to put crosshairs on…

RUSS LIQUID
Set apart from other up-and-coming West Coast bass music producers by his extensive world-touring history and performance experience, Russ Liquid brings a much-needed injection of melody and emotion to the thriving dance floor community. Classically trained on the piano, trumpet, saxophone and flute, Russ Liquid applies the colorful tones of instrumental music to the realm of beats with dance floor-rocking results. This talented producer has found an entirely new palette to “paint” with, and now he seeks to bridge the gap between classical and modern music with new electronic technology and sonic possibilities.

All events are 21+ | Please bring valid identification | NO REFUNDS MIGHTY Real w/ Louie &amp; Anane Vega
Louie Vega is the Miles Davis of dance music. Like the impossible to categorize Davis, Vega is constantly reinventing himself and revolutionizing music itself in the process. During his nearly two-decade long career, Vega has crafted some of the most innovative singles in dance music history (“The Nervous Track”, “It’s Alright”, “I Feel It” and “You Can Do It”), kick started genres like soulful house (“Beautiful People,” “I Get Lifted”), and revitalized the careers of legends like Roy Ayers, George Benson and Tito Puente.
Music has been in Anané’s blood since growing up in the Cape Verdean capital of Santiago. “My aunts and uncles were known as the Xalinos and they made most of the musical instruments on the island, such as guitars, violins, and the uncommon Cavaqinho, a small four-string guitar,” she said about her musical lineage. Anané discovered her talent for singing during family gatherings called “serenades” where people would play guitars and percussion instruments and sing a “morna,” a melancholic but beautiful ode to past times spent on the islands.
Anané eventually decided to bring her talents to New York City where, armed with nothing more than a bag full of clothes and a heart full of dreams, she immersed herself in the city’s club culture. She met DJ/Producer Louie Vega, who tapped her as an integral member of the Elements of Life Collective, and Anané used that as a stepping stone to an international career that has included appearances at Japan’s world-renowned Blue Note, Europe’s celebrated Montreux Jazz Festival, Finland’s Pori Jazz, Holland’s North Sea Jazz Festival, Cape Town’s Jazz and Britain’s Womad Festival. Perhaps her biggest gig yet was in 2007 when world-famous entertainment empire Cirque De Soleil personally approached Anané to perform the opening song for the Super Bowl XLII pre-game show. Her performance of “One Dream” was seen by more than 140 million people worldwide.

Our Location
Just 20 minutes south of downtown Houston, the Festival is held in the Bay Area Houston region located midway between Houston and Galveston in League City.

Night Three: Sunday Oct 21st at &#34;The Lounge&#34; (limited to 100 tickets)New Monsoon Unplugged
About GaryFest
New Monsoon presents a three-night concert event in tribute to their beloved friend and manager, Gary Hartman, who passed away unexpectedly on March 31st, 2012.To kick it off, New Monsoon performs at the Last Concert Café, with special guests The Hightailers (Friday) and Moses Guest (Saturday). As a special feature of the tribute, New Monsoon’s original three-headed percussion crew will reunite at the LCC to pay homage to Gary and his impact on their personal and professional lives. On Sunday, GaryFest will conclude with a special intimate evening of New Monsoon unplugged at &#34;The Lounge.&#34;Gary had a burning passion for live music, especially when played “without a net”. A lifelong Deadhead and live music taper/trader, he relished the unique nature of each show, and helped this music live on through recordings. As a live concert promoter in Houston and co-founder of Tapir Productions, he brought like-minded national touring acts to Houston. In doing so, he helped create a family of devoted music fans who came to be known as the Texas Tribe and who flourished at an amazing venue called The Last Concert Café.When New Monsoon hit the road for their first national tour in 2003, Gary was eager to give them a try. His life, along with that of the band, would never be the same. New Monsoon came to feel that Houston, and especially the Last Concert Café, was their home away from home. They&#39;ve returned each year for two and three-night stands that have become the stuff of jamband legend. In 2008 Gary formally joined the band as their manager, while continuing to bring national touring acts to Houston.The Café, and a special private space known as &#34;The Lounge&#34;, have been a destination for New Monsoon’s most ardent fans from around the nation for nearly a decade, and they&#39;ll be back in Houston with the band for the first annual GaryFest -  three glorious autumn nights to celebrate the life of their friend and mate, Gary Hartman.Special discouted tickets go on sale Monday June 25th at 10am. Ticketing fees are waived for the two and three-night packages for a limited time to reward early advance purchasing.

[FOLLOW THE LEADER]Gulf Coast Classic will be one of the largest Festivals in Houston and surrounding areas. It was created with the mission to bring families of all different cultures together to show off and take part in their shared interest and passions.At the same time the event will raise money to help local students that wish to further their education but do not have the means to do so. GCC plans to give away 2 scholarships each day of the show to local deserving students. Also benefitting the Wounded Warrior Project to help those veterans that return to their families with injuries or in need of some support to get back to their way of life.Gulf Coast Classic will have many proud owners of cars and trucks having their pride and joy on display. Also many motorcycles will be featured in the contest.Gulf Coast Classic will also have many of Houston’s finest body art shops showing off their talent in their art and trade. Everyone will come from all over to be a part of the festival that has so much artistic expressions in one location! The love and dedication that all of the participants put in to their art will be here for the world to see. From Kustom cars to classic bikes. From Hot Rods to rat rods. From tuners to kustom bikes. From off road trucks to low-rider cars scraping the pavement. From the most muscle that a car can handle to the cruisers of time past. From the classic pin-up to the progressive tattoo pin-up models that we see today. From the rock-a-billy to the psycho-billy and classic rock bands and many more live acts will be here to share in the artistic expressions of over 150 of the best body artist that the region has to offer and we welcome artist from all over the world. This will be the best blend of what the Gulf Coast has become. No longer are the artistic creations, from musicians, body artist, car and bike owners looked as sub culture. This is what the Gulf Coast Is, and it is prevalent in the festival that everyone will come to know and love to attend for decades to come! Not Just your average car show or beauty contest.

GCPA, All Points Productions &amp; Shelley Rogers are pleased to announce the inaugural Boogie, Blues and Brews. This annual event is scheduled for September 21, 22 &amp; 23. Hours are Friday from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., Sat­urday from noon to 10 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 6 p.m. The event, located in the 86 acre Walker Hall Park in beautiful League City, Texas.  League City is located in the Bay Area Houston (Clear Lake area), just minutes from NASA and The Kemah Boardwalk.
The Scoop
Boogie, Blues and Brews is a 3 day fun filled family friendly festival bringing the best of blues, rock, zydeco &amp; rockabilly along with a stage dedicated to children and teens. A huge arts and crafts market brings all sorts of shopping and promotional opportunities. An interactive ride zone keeps the excitement meter on high. Fun festival foods tempt all taste buds in the Food Court with specialty food kiosks throughout the park. A hotly contested Chili Cook Off with taster kits available is open to the public on Saturday afternoon. Local restau­rants compete for bragging rights with the first annual Sweet Tea competition. All true Texas traditions!
Our Location
Just 20 minutes south of downtown Houston, the Festival is held in the Bay Area Houston region located midway between Houston and Galveston in League City. The focal point of Bay Area Houston is Clear Lake, a 2,000-acre inlet of Galveston Bay and the third-largest pleasure boat basin in the United States. Soak up the sun and gulf breezes in Bay Area Houston — the boating capital of Texas. The region attracts visitors for fresh seafood, water recreation, stunning nature preserves and two of Texas’ top attractions – Kemah Boardwalk and Space Center Houston. 
Our Audience
With over 5 million people in the Greater Houston area and a quarter of a million calling the Bay Area Hous­ton region home, Boogie, Blues and Brews creates a superb marketing opportunity. This event is appealing to families and music lovers alike. The publicity efforts are concentrated in the Greater Houston area, with an internet campaign reaching all of Texas, the Gulf Coast and beyond .

In 2008, Lao assembled an all-star concert tour:  TIZER featuring the aforementioned Chieli Minucci and international violin virtuoso Karen Briggs (Yanni, Soul II Soul, Stanley Clarke, etc).  In 2009, Lao released Passages, a return to his roots in a more piano-oriented solo project.  2009 &amp; 2010 saw Lao and TIZER make their International Concert debuts with performances at Joy of Jazz – Johannesburg, South Africa; Dubai Jazz Fest; Barbados Jazz Fest, Java Jazz Festival – Jakarta, Indonesia; The Caribbean Sea Jazz Fest – Aruba and club performances in Seoul, South Korea.  In summer 2010, Lao released TIZER Live, which captures to spellbinding music and charisma of the TIZER concert experience.  As we enter 2011, look for Lao to begin production on a new TIZER studio project and continue his demanding tour schedule with TIZER, the all-star concert tour with Minucci and Briggs, and other configurations as he ventures further into the worldwide marketplace. 
Lao Tizer’s continuing growth as a composer is brightly refracted in the deep musical prism of his evolving artistry.  Whether he is performing solo or in concert with his extraordinary band, the future promises spectacular accomplishments from this gifted young artist. A diverse path is promised for the novice listener and experience-seeking fan.

 The Front Bottoms
http://www.thefrontbottoms.com/  “This is a pop soundtrack for learning to live in the moment.” – Los Angeles Times  “… one of the leading lights of the New Jersey pop underground.” - The Newark Star-Ledger  “NJ’s best acoustic/indie/pop act” - NJ Underground  “Simply put, The Front Bottoms play an eager and honest brand of indie rock/punk. They are catchy and accessible but they are simultaneously punk as hell…” - AbsolutePunk  ”… what guitarist/vocalist Brian Sella and drummer Mathew Uychich lack in bluster and dissonance, they make up for with lingering hooks and magnetic charm.” - Alternative Press  “The Front Bottoms is an out-of-left-field candidate for the best debut album of 2011.” - All Music Guide  “Disc of the Week… an indie pop sound similar to that of Piebald with the vocal styling of Say Anything.” - The Aquarian Weekly  “a promising debut boasting the inspired goofiness of a latter-day Jonathan Richman.” - DRUM Magazine  “… the album is endlessly fascinating.” - The Daily News “Top Ten of 2011”  ”The young duo’s smart, irreverent, self-titled debut strikes a deft balance between the comical and the emotional…” - NPR  “quirky, endearing and unapologetically unpolished duo” - The Bergen Record  “Band to Watch in 2011… I am almost certain that the Front Bottoms will remember this Summer as the Summer their careers finally took major flight.” - The Indie Post  “…quirky love songs with dollops of synths, trumpet, and strings that command your attention” - The Jersey Journal

Cheap Girls
http://www.cheapgirls.net
The state of power pop and pop-punk lately has made me feel a little disappointed. While I can appreciate a good recording and sometimes glossy tracks can still work, I am starting to grow tired of the monotony. Countless bands keep churning out the same shit album after album and occasionally songs are over polished to the point of stripping away the personality. The only thing that keeps me from entirely losing faith within that genre are the bands that thrive on the fringes of the mainstream and can appreciate the fact that a little roughness and imperfection add personality to a song. The fuzzy and rough-around-the-edges pop found on Cheap Girls’ debut Find Me A Drink Home is the perfect antidote for my indifference towards the genre. Buzzing guitars, earnest vocals, and relatable lyrics are what fuel Cheap Girls&#39; energetic debut effort. While Cheap Girls&#39; album may be a breath of fresh air and a welcome listen to those who loved the raw and sloppy tendencies of 90’s indie and alternative, those who prefer the cleaner production of today’s pop-punk and power pop bands may want to stay away. - AbsolutePunk


One of the beautiful things about huge music festivals like SXSW is that they bring a lot of really incredible bands out of the woodwork that you might never have been exposed to otherwise. Music is promoted, buzz is generated, shows are seen, more buzz, more shows, repeat forever.
Incredible Band No. 1 on my list to see this year is Cheap Girls, an Indie-punk-lo-fi-garage-college-rock-noise-pop three-piece from Lansing, Michigan. Okay, so I don’t know exactly how to categorize them. But who says you need to categorize good music? As you might have guessed from the title, their sound reminds me a little of Dinosaur Jr. à la J Mascis &amp; co., but it’s not a straight comparison by any means and I really just wanted to use the word “dinosaur” in one of my reviews.
In all seriousness, Cheap Girls have taken the chapter of angst-fueled alternative rock made popular by Dinosaur Jr., The Lemonheads, Superchunk, and other similar acts from the late ’80s and ’90s and modernized it, while still retaining some wonderful ’90s flair. Let me make this clear: this is the exact kind of band I want to be in. The sheer amount of sound generated by just three guys is pretty super impressive; energetic drums, monstrous distorted melodic guitar, and unassuming earnest vocals create the perfect recipe for a soundtrack to Windows Down Because The Weather Just Took An Amazing Turn For The Better. Which, coincidentally, is the exact environment in which I introduced myself to Cheap Girls. It’s the “power chill aesthetic,” a phrase that I just made up but that also seems to fit perfectly in this instance. It allows members Ben Graham, Ian Graham, and Adam Aymor to go as energetic as possible without sounding over-the-top or melodramatic, and it also makes you air drum voraciously in public without caring what people think. - By Matt Jones of Mattneric.com

When they’re combined with genuine talent, the sky’s the limit. And so it is for David Ray.
Following a good run in Florida, where he opened for numerous country music stars and built a following that continues to grow, Ray moved to Nashville last year to write songs for his first album, recorded at Nashville’s The Tracking Room studios. Studio manager Dan Mitchell produced the album with Ray for social media driven label, TCM Records. 
Ray got his start in his native Michigan, a state known for the likes of Bob Seger, Ted Nugent and the Eagles’ Glenn Frey. He grew up in a small town that wasn’t far from the big city, Detroit, and playing his father’s guitar, Ray gravitated towards the sounds of Michigan’s native sons, but he also was captivated by country music.
&#34;Since I did live in a small town, &#34;he said,&#34; people were into country. I grew up loving country as much as classic rock and folk, listening to people like Garth and Dwight Yoakam as well as James Taylor. My music has a rock edge but I also really love the classic country artists, the ones who inspired the people who inspired me.&#34;
He knew he wanted a career in music, but Ray did the prudent thing and pursued a college education at Central Michigan University in Mt. Pleasant just in case the music thing didn’t work out. He ended up playing regularly as a solo acoustic artist at the Cabin, a major college hangout in the mid-Michigan area. He still returns to the North Country on occasion to play at the venue where he honed his chops and learned how to work an audience.
After graduating from college, Ray set his sights on Nashville, where he planned to use his degree to teach school while learning the city and the music business. Alas, there were no jobs open in Nashville for him, even though he’d actually obtained his Tennessee teaching certificate. So he ended up accepting a teaching position in South Florida, having no idea what doors would be opened to him there.
&#34;I think it worked out for the best,&#34; Ray said, of the chain of events that followed his arrival in Florida. He learned about Kenny Chesney’s &#34;Next Big Star&#34; competition and decided to enter, first auditioning solo and then assembling a band to perform with a couple weeks after he’d been accepted. He won the competition, and soon found himself opening for Chesney himself in front of some 15,000 party-loving music lovers.
Following that victory, KISS Program Director, Ken Boesen, and his staff soon began to book David for countless station events, including Miami Dolphins and Miami Hurricanes games. KISS Country also hired Ray to play at the station’s concert venue in Fort Lauderdale, where he shared the stage with such artists as Billy Currington, Travis Tritt, Pat Green, Chris Young and American Idol champion Taylor Hicks. He received the kind of break and exposure that he probably never would have found in Nashville. 
When Ray moved to Nashville last summer he hit the ground running, performing almost as soon as he pulled into town. In addition to performing in acoustic, in-the-round settings, Ray also performes at Tootsies in Nashville’s Lower Broadway.
Florida just won’t let him go; in January 2012 he performed the National Anthem for the 3rd year at the annual KISS Country Chili Cook Off in Pembroke Pines near Fort Lauderdale. With thousands of fans assembled to see Chris Cagle, Clay Walker, Luke Bryan, and Zac Brown Band, Ray had a captive audience as he opened the festivities.
Today, Ray’s time in Nashville is spent performing or at writing appointments with various Nashville hit songwriters.

    THE ARTIST - Harmonia do Samba
A well known name in the Brazilian music scene, the group “Harmonia do Samba” has come a long way since the release of &#34;Vem Nenen&#34; in 1999. Today, 18 years later, the group is a reference when we quote Brazilian music, “pagode”, axé or samba and, it keeps winning more fans in Bahia,  Brazil and worldwide every day.
A very significant number of sold CD’s, concerts and fans make the group “Harmonia do Samba” a reference name in the musical scene of Bahia and Brazil. Altogether the group makes an average of 120 concerts in Brazil and abroad per year and brings altogether more than four million records, between twelve released CDs and three DVDs. In 2011, the group has made 160 concerts. Every year, the group holds an international tour, and already has traveled through almost all regions of Europe. The group has great names as Xanddy, Roque Cezar, Bimba, Martins and Luciano. “Harmonia do Samba” knows how to mix the swings of “pagode” and axé, creating a very unique rhythm which keeps gathering followers around the world.
AWARDS - With a collection of success throughout all of its performances, the “Harmonia do Samba” has achieved a lot in its career. In the CD “Micareta de Feira” from 2010, for example, the song &#34;Comando&#34; was voted the ” Best Music&#34; and in 2011 the group was chosen as the &#34;Best Pagode Group&#34;. In the 2011’s Carnaval, the group has won six trophies amongst some of the Carnaval’s major awards: “Banda Folia”, “Castro Alves” and “Itapoan FM”(all from Bahia). The “Banda Folia” gave to “Harmonia do Samba”  the trophy of &#34;Best Pagode Band&#34;. For the Itapoan FM radio, Xanddy won the title of the &#34;Best Pagode Singer &#34; and the band was voted the &#34;Best Pagode Band&#34;. In addition, Itapoan FM radio elected the band’s rehearsal which was named “Best Monday of the World&#34;, as the &#34;Best rehearsal of the Summer &#34; in 2011. The ”Castro Alves” award, honored the group in the categories &#34;Best  Pagode Group &#34; and &#34;Best Pagode Bloco.&#34;
For two consecutive years, the group made the nominees to win the Latin Grammy Award. In 2008 the “Harmonia do Samba” ran for  the Grammy award in the category &#34;Best Contemporary Regional Music Album&#34;, with the CD &#34;Esse Som Vai Te Levar - Live.&#34; In 2009, the group led by Xanddy was a finalist in the category &#34;Best Album in Samba / Pagode&#34;, with the CD / DVD “Harmonia – Romantico - Live, released in December of 2008. Now, the “Harmonia do Samba” brings its incredible success and talent to US again. With its USA TOUR 2012Philmont Pharewell Phinale featuring Mine All Mine, UnmaskD, and Empty Me

Usually this masquerade party will last until midnight where all the people attending are unmasked.

SOLDIER OF LIGHT
 
&#34; Teri Catlin is the love child Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin never had.
 
With a powerful, acrobatic voice that embodies the spirit of the voices of all major female artist. It settles in the stunning range established by the late blues singer Joplin, and guitar chops that would make some of the best guitarist ever proud, Catlin is a one-of-a-kind entertainer who truly deserves to be heard. &#34;
Quote from Audio Pages
Albany, GA
 
Teri Catlin is an artist that gives back to the children, planet, people, and animals!  Her music has always maintained a positive focus on human welfare, animals and the environment. Some artists have such a personal vision, that their work takes on a universal character. Some songwriters have such an insight into the joys and frustrations of everyday life, that they somehow express what the rest of us are feeling too. And some singers have such heart and soul, that the sound of their voice brings a story to life right before our eyes. Teri Catlin is one of these rare artists, a singer/songwriter in the rock/R&amp;B tradition whose music is original and authentic--and a live performer whose stage presence is captivating and charismatic. 
 
As Teri says of her work: “If I had to choose one word to describe what I do, I’ve always seen myself as a storyteller. No matter what kind of songs I write--from love ballads to political, social, and/or environmental issues--I’m always telling a story, painting pictures with words, melodies, and the sound of my voice. And I’ve always preferred live performance in front of an audience. That’s where the songs take on a life of their own, night after night.”
 
Born in Flint, Michigan, Teri was given up for adoption at birth. Never knowing the identity of her bio-logical mother or father. Teri began singing before she could talk and  was in a foster home until just before her second birthday.  She was then adopted into an extremely abusive home where music quickly became her focus. Bringing her peace, creativity and calm, Teri began teaching herself how to play the piano and drums when she was just five years young. At the tender age of seven, she began writing songs and started taking lessons on the violin, quickly became known as a child prodigy on the instrument, performing for such luminaries as Itzhak Perlman, who was mesmerized by Teri’s talent. By age twelve, Teri became a soloist with the Flint Symphony Orchestra, receiving rave reviews in the regional music press. She then studied for three years with the Wisconsin Symphony School of America, winning a Silver Medal in the Worldwide Orchestra Competition in Ottawa, Canada. 
 
But due to a traumatic home environment, Teri felt an urgent need to break free, becoming a homeless runaway at the tender age of fourteen, making money playing piano and singing Top 40 music in bars, hotels, and restaurants. Eventually drifting from Michigan to the friendlier warmer climate of South Florida, Teri planted her roots and taught herself to play an arsenal of instruments including the guitar, bass, djembe, doumbek, didgeridoo and the wooden flute. She also began honing her skills as a songwriter and vocalist with a style and personality all her own. Naturally Teri writes and can play all of the parts for her music ( Drums, Bass, Piano, String arrangements, Lead/Rhythm Guitars, all Vocals etc.) and has added a talented drummer, bassist, and keyboardist to form the Teri Catlin Band. They&#39;ve been playing shows on the east and west coast for over seven years and are known for their electrifying performances. Teri has built a huge loyal following which continues to grow with each performance.
 
Teri has produced both her self-titled debut CD and her second CD,&#34;Solder of Light,&#34; featuring  her most compelling songs, from the love ballad “Baby” to the spiritual “I Am,” then she kicks down the doors with the hard-hitting urban realism of “Castles” and “Cry,” to the sexy blues-drenched rocker “Get Off,” to the triumphant personal anthems “Alive,” “Stand Your Ground,” “Who I Am,”  and &#34;Fly&#34;, to environment awareness issues of &#34;A Better Way,&#34; and &#34;Candyland.&#34; Each performance has its own unique power and flavor, with the vivid imagery of Teri’s lyrics combined with her unconventional approach to melody and arrangement.
 
Although her songs cover a wide range of topics and emotions, Teri says: “All of my music basically comes down to one thing--the experience of being alive, with all of the joy and pain that goes with it. We have one life to live, and one planet to live it on. We owe it to ourselves and to the world around us to give it everything we’ve got. Whether I’m singing about love or war, it’s all about the same thing--keeping it real. My heroes are the same great people that we all revere: Bob Marley, Gandhi, John Lennon, Maya Angelo, Curtis Mayfield, Dalai Lama, Marvin Gaye, Dylan, Dr.Martin Luther King, Bono, Jane Goodall, Prince--people who stand up for what they believe in and speak straight from the heart. You might call them Soldiers of Light. That’s where I’m coming from.”

Music of Germany
The Miami Chamber Players

Concert will feature the Miami Chamber Players performing music by the German composers J. S. Bach and J. Brahms.
Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 in G major, BWV 1048 &amp; No. 6 in B flat major, BWV 1051, The Brandenburg concertos by Johann Sebastian Bach are a collection of six instrumental works presented by Bach to Christian Ludwig, margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt, in 1721. They are widely regarded as among the finest musical compositions of the Baroque era.
The Piano Quintet in F minor, opus 34, by Johannes Brahms was completed during the summer of 1864 and published in 1865. It was dedicated to Her Royal Highness the Princess Anne of Hesse. Like most piano quintets, it is written for piano and string quartet (two violins, viola and cello). Both piano and strings play an equally important role throughout this work.
The Miami Chamber Players is a professional ensemble of rotating Miami-based award-winner musicians who get together to play the world&#39;s best chamber music in intimate spaces. Musicians for this performance include: Tomas Cotik, Ashley Garritson, Maria Assunta Bucco, Georgeta Spiridon, Daniel Andai, Viera Borisova &amp; Adolfo Vidal, among others.
The Miami World-Music Festival was created by South Florida Friends of Classical Music, a non-profit organization to encourage and support the musical heritage of countries around the world. The annual Festival features academic, traditional and contemporary music from diverse cultures performed by acclaimed world-class artists. The festival emphasizes chamber music written by the greatest composers of all time, and also showcases folk music events using traditional world instruments. The 2012 Festival presents five concerts representing music from Germany, Cuba, Spain, Russia &amp; Argentina.

 Music of Cuba
Tiempo Libre


The three-time Grammy-nominated Cuban music group Tiempo Libre is one the hottest young Latin bands today. Equally at home in concert halls, jazz clubs and dance venues, Tiempo Libre’s Miami-based members are true modern heirs to the rich tradition of the music of their native Cuba. Classically trained at Cuba’s premiere conservatories, today, the group is a hit in the U.S. and abroad, celebrated for its incendiary, joyful performances of timba, an irresistible, dance-inducing mix of high-voltage Latin jazz and the seductive rhythms of son.
The group’s new Sony Masterworks timba recording, My Secret Radio, will be released May 3, 2011. The album pays homage to Tiempo Libre’s teenage years in Cuba, a time when the government forbade its citizens to listen to American music and Russian had pulled its support from the island. Inspired by their Afro-Cuban tradition, but eager to catch the new trends and sounds coming from the U.S., Tiempo Libre’s members would fashion homemade antennas and secretly listen to the music pulsating from Miami radio stations at night. These secret radio sessions fueled Tiempo Libre’s dreams of living in America, free to perform their songs and build the careers they wanted while helping them gather the strength that it took to leave it all behind – families, friends, a country, a life – to pursue those dreams. The CD is their tribute to the many powerful voices, including Michael Jackson, Chaka Khan, Gloria Estefan and Earth Wind &amp; Fire, that rocked their world. The album features guest performances by jazz singer Rachelle Fleming and reunites Tiempo Libre founder Jorge Gomez with the legendary Cuban songstress Albita.
Tiempo Libre’s first recording for Sony Masterworks, Bach in Havana, was nominated for a Grammy award for “Best Tropical Latin Album” and featured tracks with Paquito D’Rivera and Yosvany Terry. The CD, a fusion of Bach with Afro-Cuban rhythms, reflects the duality of Tiempo Libre’s childhood days studying classical music and nights spent playing timba music. Released in May, 2009, the album received airplay on more than 200 radio stations, was hailed by Latin Jazz Network as “a landmark recording in the sense that Miles Davis&#39;s Kind of Blue was approximately 50 years ago” and was selected as a best pick in new Latin music by The Miami Herald. The group performed “Tu Conga Bach” from the CD on the October 27, 2009 Dancing with the Stars. In conjunction with the release of Bach in Havana, the family behind Bustelo Café – for the first time in 80 years – changed its Bustelo Café coffee can to feature Tiempo Libre with a free music download.
Tiempo Libre was invited to collaborate on the duet “Para Ti” with violinist Joshua Bell, which was featured on Bell’s September album At Home with Friends. The group also performed the track with Bell on The Tonight Show with Conan O’Brien, the January 21st Live From Lincoln Center: Joshua Bell @ Home with Friends PBS Special and on WNYC radio’s popular program Soundcheck. In the fall of 2008, Tiempo Libre brought its dynamic Afro-Cuban beat to leading flutist Sir James Galway’s album, O’Reilly Street, released by the RCA Red Seal label. The album features an exciting new Latin jazz arrangement of music from the Claude Bolling Jazz Suites including “Baroque and Blue”, as well as a timba take on Bach&#39;s “Badinerie” and a number of vibrant new compositions all by Tiempo Libre’s musical director and pianist Jorge Gomez. The result is rich in the traditions of multiple genres, authentic yet emotionally seductive, transcending the borders between classical, jazz and Cuban music.
Tiempo Libre’s members were all enjoying thriving careers in Latin music performing, touring and recording with such artists as Albita, Cachao, Arturo Sandoval, NG La Banda, Gonzalo Rubalcaba and Isaac Delgado, when the seven extraordinary musicians came together to realize their collective musical dream: to create the first authentic all-Cuban timba band in the United States. Their eagerness to share their music with others led these multi-talented individuals to come together between projects to develop their new style together, hence the name Tiempo Libre (Free Time).
Since their formation in 2001, the members of Tiempo Libre have been on a mission: to share the musical heritage in which they grew up with as wide an audience as possible, reinterpreting and reinvigorating traditional Cuban music with a youthful, modern sound and forging a new style born from the meeting of their Cuban roots and their new American experience. In Summer 2002, at the group’s Ravinia Festival debut opening for Celia Cruz, Tiempo Libre dazzled a crowd of more than 12,000 people. They were quickly reengaged by Ravinia for Summer 2003, where they shared a bill with Aretha Franklin, performing before an enthusiastic crowd of 20,000. Summer 2003 also included performances at the new Heineken Jazz Festival in Hua Hin, Thailand where Tiempo Libre were the undeniable sensation of the Festival. Return trips to Asia have included sold out shows at Hong Kong’s Kwai Tsing Theatre and the Dewan Filharmonik Petronas, the glorious concert hall at the foot of the famous twin towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and at the 2005 Java Jazz Festival in Jakarta, Indonesia. Since that time, the group’s busy touring schedule in the United States has included performances at the Playboy Jazz Festival at the Hollywood Bowl, Miami’s JVC Jazz Festival, Yoshi’s in Oakland, CA, SOB’s in New York City, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Celebrate Brooklyn, New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, Festival International de Louisiane, Rochester International Jazz Festival, the Royal Conservatory in Toronto, the Lincoln Theater in Napa Valley, Boston’s Sculler’s Jazz Club, Society of the Performing Arts in Houston, Kimmel Center, Orange County Performing Arts Center, California Center for the Arts, New Haven Jazz Festival, California World Fest, Lotus Music Festival, New York’s River-to-River Festival at the South Street Seaport, as well as the Colorado, Interlochen, Green and Eastern music festivals. August, 2005 brought Tiempo Libre’s European debut. Among the highlights of that tour, was Tiempo Libre’s performance at the closing concert of the new Tuscan Sun Festival in Cortona, Italy where the band wowed a sold-out house. Subsequent tours have brought sold-out houses in Italy, Greece and Turkey.
Tiempo Libre is: Musical Director Jorge Gomez on keyboard; Raúl Rodríguez, trumpet; Leandro Gonzalez, congas; Wilvi Rodriguez Guerra, bass; Armando (Pututi) Arce, drums; Joaquin (El Kid) Diaz, lead vocal; and Luis Beltran Castillo, saxophone &amp; flute.

Brenden&#39;s Birthday Bash featuring JunoWhat?! w/ El Groundscoro!
Band Bio

 Formed in late 2009, Juno What?! have quickly become the leading practitioners of high energy, live electro-funk and disco booty-jams. Hailing from Denver Colorado, they are now bringing their shameless dance party to stages across the country. Catalyzing dance floors into sonic landscapes, the band has ignited a devoted following by providing raw, electrifying shows which are devoid of the aimless wanderings of the lesser jam community. Their sound is ahead of its time yet still rooted in the foundation of early-80’s electro dance grooves. Featuring the soulful talkbox vocals of both Joey Porter and Steve Watkins and the hard hitting backbeat of Dave Watts, it is easy to see that this is a musical force to be reckoned with.

Teengirl Fantasy
Teengirl Fantasy are currently coming off a huge year, one which has seen them release their long-awaited debut LP “7AM” to widespread critical acclaim on both sides of the Atlantic, with everyone from Pitchfork and The Fader to Dazed and Confused and DJ Magazine becoming entranced by their beguilingly off-kilter vein of sprawling, throbbing electronica. The album ended up on more year-end lists than can be counted, with Time Out even naming them one of 5 bands to watch in 2011, and the likes of the Guardian, FACT, Juno and XLR8R selecting their genre-defying, breakthrough anthem “Cheaters” as one of the best tracks of the year. Just as the album is one of the most beautiful and unusual things you’re likely to hear, so their shows are also truly unmissable events, and rare opportunities to see the pair play their music where it truly belongs — in a live setting, on a dancefloor.

Gatekeeper
Pineal activation. IMAX phantasy. Drippy acid ecosystems. HD....everything. All contribute to the sentient environment that is Exo, Gatekeeper&#39;s debut LP dropping on LA-based label Hippos In Tanks. Demented and celebratory, sinister but pure-hearted, Exo is a cerebral spectacle, a gapless playback rush of digitally-enhanced stimulation.&#39;

BHAKTI: Known for being the easiest path for Self Realization and accessing our eternal connection with God in this &#34;Age of Kali&#34;, it is the sweet and easy method to end our sense of separateness and egoism.  A practice of intense love and devotion, which is not merely a state of emotionalism, but a thorough discipline and training of the mind.  A practice of constant meditation of the Divine, the ways by which can be accessed most directly through singing, the loving Names of the Divine.  Thus opening the heart, the spirit, the body, the mind, and our beautiful voices to unite us as one temple; uniting us to our original place of Sat Chit Ananda. 
Come join this workshop of exploring our own practice of Bhakti Yoga, as well as the ancient stories of living examples, who developed themselves through the 9 stages and Bhakti Yoga. We will discuss the preliminary stages of Bhakti to the advanced stages where the mind becomes softened.

Winnie Cooper and The Waldorf present
Jonathan Toubin&#39;s Soul &amp; Clap Dance-Off
Jonathan Toubin is the most popular, prolific and highest-earning DJ of his kind in America, known equally for his “maximum rock and soul” 45rpm dance sets around North America and his formative New York Night Train club in Brooklyn. He’d played 1200 sets of his hi-octane 50s-80s classics over the last 5 years, before a freak life-threatening accident in January (a taxi driver had a seizure and ploughed into a sleeping Toubin through a ground-floor hotel room wall). Support came quickly from across the music community – including a Yeah Yeahs Yeahs benefit concert – and he made a miraculous recovery. Now, as befits someone who was reported to have made a “gotta have my records” request in his emergency ward, he’s thankfully back in the vinyl groove again.

Cedric Benson aka DJ Worldpeace will be mixing up the best electro-house tracks at The Madison this Saturday.  Doors at 10:00 pm.Eliot Lipp didn’t choose to become one of the most looked to artists in contemporary electronic music, but somehow, Lipp’s sound, one that uses vintage gear to create a unique take on Hip Hop and House, has quickly garnered the respect among the industry’s most influential musicians and producers as well as the deep admiration among audiences worldwide.   Since being discovered by Scott Herren (aka Prefuse 73) in the mid 2000’s, and releasing albums on the cutting edge labels Eastern Developments, Mush and Hefty as well as backing the hype with a relentless touring schedule of influential live shows all over the globe, Lipp has quickly become one of the barometers for the revival of electronic music in the States.  Originally hailing from Tacoma, WA, Lipp paid his dues in the underground scenes of almost every primary market in the US, Europe and Asia, including stints in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago before dropping roots in the Brooklyn scene that has continued to produce some of the most recognized artists in contemporary indie and electronic music.   Lipp’s signature sound, a crossbreed of 90’s Hip Hop and House, 70’s Funk fusion as well as classic Electro, has and will continue to breakdown barriers and transpose trendy scenes. Whether programming Hip Hop beats, writing dirty basslines, collaborating with the likes of premier producers, DJs, MCs and musicians, examined by SPIN, URB, Pitchfork and other media or playing popping parties at clubs and festivals worldwide, Eliot Lipp will continue to do his part in revolutionizing electronic music.

Join us for a day filled with more Rush related fun than you can handle. Mingle with your new-found Rush friends, test your Rush trivia, and win some glittering prizes! In the afternoon, stretch your arms and get ready to pounce on the amazing Rush goodies we&#39;ll have on the auction block in our annual Charity Memorabilia Auction.
 
John Arrowsmith will also be joining us, then rock out Saturday night to our official RushCon tribute band! (TBA)
Countdown: Six players must &#34;Name that Rush tune&#34; in a matter of seconds. One player is eliminated at the end of each round. Who will make it to the final Countdown? Randomly selected short clips (three to seven seconds) from Rush&#39;s vast catalog makes this game an exciting challenge for both the players and the audience. (When was the last time you listened to Here Again? Losing It? Armor and Sword?)
Afterimage: A Tribute to Andrew MacNaughtan: A touching photographic tribute to the late Andrew MacNaughtan, photographer and long-time friend of Rush.
RushCon Charity Auction Our annual RushCon charity auction features a selection of rare and collectible Rush memorabilia, courtesy of various donors. All winning bids are final and binding. Payment is required at the event in order to take items home. Highly entertaining to watch, even if you are not bidding!
We are looking for donations of Rush memorabilia &amp; collectible items for our annual Charity Auction. Please send donation information to auction@rushcon.org, with a full item description &amp; photo.
  Guest Speaker: JOHN ARROWSMITH
John Arrowsmith began his strive for working with Rush in 1980 when he first heard 2112 and Moving Pictures at his neighbours house. He had always maintained that he was born a decade too late and thus would have had a greater chance to work with them sooner. 
John began in 1987 working with many hopeful bands touring Canada,  he then moved to the Toronto area to get closer and continue that endeavour, finding himself working at several sound/lighting companies in the city. Eventually learning a certain band used lasers, John found himself at the front door of Laserlite FX in 1990 hoping to fulfill the dream. Sadly this would not happen but he did move up to working with a couple of major acts, Def Leppard and Pink Floyd. 
The next phase started at a corporate event doing lasers, he met the big cheese of Pyrotek and began working for him shortly thereafter. However had John used a &#34;connection&#34; to get into Pyrotek instead of &#34;doing it his way&#34;, he would have found himself on the Presto tour. Idiot!
It would not be until 2002 when he finally started working on Vapor Trails.
For many years, like all of you, he enjoyed looking at the photos shared with us. John was a big fan of Fin Costello and of course Andrew MacNaughtan among others. During the S&amp;A tour he was fortunate enough to get behind a lens himself along with his pyro duties.
And here we are, Clockwork Angels. 
RUSH TRIBUTE SHOW (this is a 19+ event)
Rock out to the sounds of our awesome RushCon tribute band (TBA) with your fellow Rush friends!  A friendly warning: this may not be your average Rush tribute show... ;)
 ON DISPLAY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY ONLY: Neil Peart’s 1974 Chrome Slingerland drum kit - “Chromey” Just after joining Rush and recieving his first paycheck, Neil Peart bought a new drum kit to play on Rush’s first American tour. The chrome Slingerland kit was comprised of two kick drums, four copper-wrap concert toms, three mounted toms and a floor tom, and was anchored by Neil’s famous copper wrap snare drum. In addition to that first tour, Neil played this kit - nicknamed “Chromey” - on the albums Fly By Night, Caress of Steel, 2112 and All The World’s A Stage. He also played it on the tours for those albums until the Spring of 1977 when it was retired. Ten years later Chromey came out of storage to be awarded in a Modern Drummer drum solo competition, judged by Neil. Mark Feldman of New York City won the drum kit, but apparantly never played it. It was in storage for 22 years until he auctioned it off in 2008. Dean Bobisud, a major Rush fan and collector in Chicago purchased the kit and has done extensive restoration including completing the kit with full, accuate hardware, cymbal array, and additional percussion. Rather than hiding the kit away in storage, Dean wants to share the kit with Rush fans everywhere who can appreciate this unique piece of rock history, and has used the kit to raise money for charity.

With our ears still ringing on Sunday morning, we will gather for a day of game show style activities, a viewing of an amazing 3D photography exhibition and a special appearance by “Clockwork Angels” author Kevin J. Anderson.
We wrap up the convention, then....RUSH live at the Air Canada Centre! (Need we say more?)
ANTHEM RECORDS TOUR The wonderful folks at Anthem/SRO Entertainment are once again allowing us to conduct a private RushCon Anthem Records tour. Their front offices are full of awards and honours for their artists, including a certain Canadian trio.  We will congregate outside the Courtyard Marriott at 9.30am before walking the few blocks to their office (approx. 1.3 km). Photography will be permitted.
A sign-up sheet for the tour will be at our RushCon info table on Saturday. You must be a RushCon attendee and on the sign-up sheet to join us on this tour.  Freeze This Moment - The 3D Rush Fan Experience The journey of being a concert-going Rush fan doesn&#39;t end with the last note. Live the full &#39;fan experience&#39; told through moving 3D photography from beyond the front row. See the stories from the die-hard fans who hit the road following the tour, the friendships formed along the way, and the live Rush experience itself. You will feel as if you are there, and the images will jump off the screen in this exclusive RushCon multi-media event.
Jeopardy:Hard-core Rush related trivia. Based on the popular television game show, three players will be given Rush-related answers, and have to come up with the question! The trivia spans the band&#39;s entire career, and is drawn from the albums, tourbooks, interviews, videos, concerts, artwork, literature, and even from Rush fandom! Start reading now - you only have a short time to memorize forty years of Rush history!
Words of the Profits3 teams of 2 people are pitched in a battle of the wits in this fast-paced &#34;Taboo&#34; style game. The object of the game is to get your teammate to guess a specific keyword without using any of the banned clue words. Highly entertaining for the players and audience alike!
Guest Speaker Kevin J. Anderson  Come explore the magical steampunk world of Clockwork Angels from the mind of the author himself!  RushCon is thrilled to announce that “Clockwork Angels: The Novel” author Kevin J. Anderson, will be our Sunday guest speaker. Kevin collaborated closely with Neil Peart in the creation of the Clockwork Angels story. This is not the first time the duo has worked together - both created a dark fantasy short story, “Drumbeats,” and Neil also wrote an introduction for Kevin’s collection “Landscapes.” Two of Kevin&#39;s many novels—The Edge of the World and Hopscotch—are dedicated to Neil. Kevin&#39;s first novel Resurrecrion, Inc. was directly inspired by &#34;Grace Under Pressure.&#34;
He is the author of over 100 science fiction and fantasy novels, including “The Saga of Seven Suns” series, the Terra Incognita trilogy, many Star Wars novels, and he coauthored twelve bestselling Dune novels. Visit Kevin&#39;s website at http://www.wordfire.com
Kevin will read from “Clockwork Angels” and share his experiences of the creation of the novel. Books will be on sale and Kevin will do an book signing.

Just days before we pack it up and haul it down to Burning Man we’re setting up Super Street Fire and giving you the chance to fight fire with fire (literally) by trying out our interactive fire installation.In the style of Street Fighter 2, Super Street Fire pits two opponents against each other for up to three rounds of fiery combat. Wearing specially designed motion sensing gloves, every punch you throw will send a wave of flame towards your opponent. Will your opponent retaliate or succumb to fiery damage? We invite you to come down to Amsterdam Brewery on Saturday, August 11, 2012 to find out.Yes, it involves punching fire. And yes, YOU can throw the punches. Any questions?
A $10 donation makes you a Super Street Fire Supporting Member, which gives you access to the event where you can see the project in action, talk to the artists and (if you&#39;re early enough) get a chance to play the game!
 
Want VIP access and guaranteed fight time? A successful contribution of $25 makes you a VIP Donor and gives all the above perks plus special skip-the-line privileges! 
 
Pints of Amsterdam Beer will be sold at the ridiculously low price of $5!!!!A year ago, we created a moment...
A friend came to us and said that for his birthday, he wanted to have me spin. He wanted to know which club I was at the night of his brithday so he could bring the party there.
I was booked off that night, but thought, &#34;hey, lemme do something different...&#34;
What would be different?
What would be fun?
What would be the kind of party I would have in my house (if I could fit 100+ people in my house)?
 
This has been an amazing year for The Speakeasy. We&#39;ve managed to throw the parties we want to throw and, more importantly, the kind of parties you want to go to.
 
The moment became a movement, and now it&#39;s time to celebrate.
August 10
Location to be revealed...
 
For this Speakeasy, we&#39;re doing it a little bigger, but it&#39;s still FREE (spend your money at the bar), but you need to register.
Trust me, you&#39;ll want to.
 
See you August 10

 The Z-List &amp; Union Electronic Presents:RAChttp://www.facebook.com/remixartistcollectiveRAC is a group of international members who create re-interpretative rock/electronica/dance remixes for musical artists. RAC strives to maintain a style of remixing that strays from the &#34;club mix&#34; archetype, creating new incarnations of songs that stem from the original structure, but expand on their genre and musical arrangement. RAC mixes typically feature a unique blend of hip-hop and vintage drum machine samples, analog synthesizers, melodic hooks, and original performed instrumentation by the remix artists themselves. &#34;Unlike many electronic remixes, which are commonly technical and precise, RAC mixes embody a unique aesthetic based around emotion and nuance, an almost intangible warmth and innate playfulness.with Resident MEDLEYhttps://www.facebook.com/medleymakesmovesFRIDAY AUGUST 3, 2012VIRGIN MOBILE MOD CLUBDoors 10:30 PM –  19+ADVANCED TICKETS AVAILABLE ONLINE$15.00 + S/C - http://www.ticketelephant.com/Z_List/rac/In Person: Rotate This, Soundscapes, Play De Record (coming soon)Real Good x Shaman x Roundtable x The Academypresent...BODYROCK 4featuring The Magnificent 7 DeejaysMENSA .

The Soul You Love...Live at the Mountain Theatre, 526 Concession Street, Hamilton, ON on Wednesday, August 15th at 7:00 pm. is Vektor and Fatality with Invective, Psyothic and Quiet Lakes. VEKTOR is a progressive sci-fi thrash metal band from Tempe, Arizona, USA. They portray the future as a bleak, barren wasteland that has been destroyed by greed, power, corruption, hate, violence, ignorance, and control. It is a journey into controversial places. It is the questioning of reality, existence, minds, souls, and the fleeting feeling of fullness in them. FATALITY is the thrash metal quartet hailing from Toronto, Canada. FATALITY brings an explosive form of high-energy thrash to its fans and a relentlessly untiring beer-drenched live show. FATALITY is uncompromising in its endeavors and unwavering in its determination. Providing local support for VEKTOR &amp; FATALITY are Hamilton&#39;s own PSYOTHIC, INVECTIVE, and QUIET LAKES. Doors open at 6:00 pm. Tickets are $8.00 in advance and $10.00 at the door and are available online at www.mountaintheatre.ca, through local ticket outlets and at the door.

A part of the Hamilton music scene since the early 70’s, Teenage Head came together when four young guys from Westdale High School in Hamilton, Ontario decided to form a band. Gord Lewis, Frank Kerr, Steve Mahon, and Nick Stipanitz weren’t buddies, but each had a strong interest in the same type of music. By May 1978 they released their first independent single Picture My Face and quickly became part of the scene exploding in Toronto. Spin Dizzy are a Rock n’ Roll band from Hamilton, Ontario. The band has relentlessly toured the Canadian bar circuit, and have made quite the name for themselves in the Hamilton music scene. Spin Dizzy are guaranteed to bring you one of the sleaziest, loudest, and most in your face performances of the year. Dean Irvine, Mike Park and Loeden Learn are Dawn Before Descent. At the end of the day, these are three tight rockers who know their stuff and love what they do. Their self titled CD is finally here so get on the DB4D bandwagon so you can be one of those people to say “I knew them when…..” Doors open at 7:00 pm. Tickets are $15.00 in advance and $20.00 at the door and are available online at www.mountaintheatre.ca, through local ticket outlets and at the door.

 Live at the Mountain Theatre, 526 Concession Street, Hamilton, ON on Friday, August 24th at 7:00 pm. is Cauldron with Deathmarch, Legions and Psyothic. Spawned out of the untimely disbanding of Goat Horn, Cauldron features Jason Decay (bass/vocals), Ian Chains (guitar) and Chris Rites (drums). The high energy traditional heavy metal three piece have built a steady following while producing a fresh heavy metal sound built out of a passion and love for the genre, and a deep understanding of the elements that go into making memorable straight-up metal music. The band&#39;s sound encompasses all the best elements of classic metal, with nods to old school NWOBHM and a focus on stand out riffs and sung vocals. After numerous tours throughout North America and Europe in support of their new album, Cauldron has returned home to work on their new album, which is due for release in late 2012. Deathmarch is a Canadian metal band, hailing from Hamilton Ontario. DEATHMARCH released one album via Northern Storm Records in October 2007. Self-titled and clocking in at 50 minutes, the CD showcases an electric mix of blackened melo-death metal. No one knows for sure what is in store for the future of Deathmarch, but they are well on their way to achieving success on the Canadian, and worldwide metal scene and nothing will stand in their way! Legions are a Power Metal band based in Burlington, Ontario. They’ve been playing the Ontario metal circuit since 2010 and have opened for such bands as: SABATON, 3 INCHES OF BLOOD, SKULL FIST and THE CATALYST. Legions blend together dueling guitar harmonies, epic keyboard melodies, and soaring vocals which are reminiscent of Power Metal god’s BLIND GUARDIAN and SYMPHONY X. Hometown headbangers Psyothic have been playing around the Hamilton metal scene for the past few years.

The Resound Conference is about amplifyingthe sound that God placed within us.
 
Join us this November 16 - 17 for a weekend of worship &amp; teaching designed for worshippers, artisans, creatives, &amp; God-lovers. Through several breakout sessions and four main sessions you’ll learn how to bring your unique sound to life &amp; reverberate the love of Jesus in our world.
 
We’ve invited some friends from around the country. But make no mistake…this conference is not about attracting people to attractive people.  It&#39;s about attracting the very Presence of God through a convening of burning hearts.   When we come close to God, we come closer to who He made us to be.
 
When the Father speaks, things happen.  He fashions galaxies with the words of His mouth and knit you together with the sound of his voice.  That sound has not stopped.  It is in you. In your breath. In your bones. Your life is a message of His beauty, love, &amp; goodness written as a love letter to the world.  You are evidence that God is still speaking.  In Christ, you are the sound of God on earth.

When it comes to your child’s education… MUSIC MATTERS.
At the core of every innovator, scientist, teacher, artist, doctor, author, actor, and CEO is a musician. Just ask Thomas Jefferson. Albert Einstein. Paul Allen. Or Steve Martin.
Research proves that music is the best activity for nurturing every area of a child’s development. From birth onward, music is the optimum vehicle for learning!
Every Kindermusik class immerses your child in a rich, developmentally appropriate environment. Our multi-sensory approach allows children to see, feel, hear and then express concepts in their own creative way. Join us as we dance, sing, listen, play and pretend. Connect with other families, and discover how music makes parenting easier.
 
 
Explore Classes and View Schedual!
Village - Newborn to 18 Months
A Kindermusik Village class is a special place for connecting with other parents and babies through musical learning. You’ll learn about your baby’s unique development, and how to encourage growth of the neurological connections in your little one’s brain. Together, you’ll sing, dance, play, snuggle and discover during activities that stimulate and engage all of the senses.
 
Our Time - 18 Months to 3 Years
In a Kindermusik Our Time class, your child will uncover an engaging musical world that encourages creativity and nurtures social development as you play instruments, sing, move and explore together. As you provide the security and comfort she still needs, she’ll learn how to control her body, speak her mind, and build the independence she wants.
 
Imagine That - 3 through 5 Years
In a Kindermusik Imagine That class, your preschooler’s soaring imagination takes off on a musical journey of discovery and exploration. Musical activities are integrated with vocal development, storytelling, movement and literature to capture your child’s potential to learn and to encourage cognitive and literacy skills, creativity and individuality.

 Perpetual Groove has spent the last ten years expanding their loyal audience and musical theatrics to international, critical acclaim.  The quartet has continued to evolve their genre-bending, highly organized sound with their musical collection touching on elements of jazz, indie-rock, R&amp;B, progressive rock, trance, and anthemic arena rock.  They also have an eclectic and surprising list of covers ranging from Paul Simon to Rage Against the Machine.  Their live performances are only enhanced by their polished, intelligent light show.  With their vast catalog of both original songs, as well as covers, each live show is truly a unique experience, having never played the same set twice. 
Strong lyrical content is backed by enticing guitar riffs, harmonizing melodies, pounding synthesizers, and unstoppable drum beats.  With four albums under their belt (Sweet Oblivious Antidote; All this Everything; Live, Love, Die; and Heal) PGroove continues to experiment and push the envelope in regards to their unique sound.  PGroove’s live shows are not one to be missed.  Whether they are playing to 20,000 fans such as they did during their Bonnaroo set or in more intimate settings such as their own festival, Amberland, Perpetual Groove continues to bridge the gap between fans and musicians.  Camaraderie and a real sense of community amongst the fans is truly what makes PGroove stand out above the rest.  Come to a show, enjoy the tunes, and meet some new friends along the way.
