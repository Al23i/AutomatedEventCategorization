MCBC Mt. Tam Dirt Fondo, an Epic Ride in the Birthplace of Mountain Biking!
The Marin County Bicycle Coalition is proud to announce the Mt. Tam Dirt Fondo, an all-day mountain bike fundrasing ride on Sunday, September 9, 2012. We encourage bicyclists of all skill levels to join us on one of the most spectacular and challenging off-road bicycle rides you&#39;ll experience!
The Mt. Tam Dirt Fondo is presented by Cannondale Bicycles. The ride will start in the Marin Headlands at the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, just north of the Golden Gate Bridge. The 45-mile route takes cyclists on a journey that climbs and descends a number of ranges before the ascent to the top of Mt. Tamalpais. After stopping to take in the amazing view, riders will continue on a loop around the mountain and then head back to the Headlands for a BBQ feast and stories around the campfire.
Mountain bike pioneers Joe Breeze, Gary Fisher and Otis Guy and NorCal Founding Matt Fritziger have RSVPd for the epic 45-mile ride with 7,000 feet of elevation gain! While not everyone is prepared to ride such a great distance, we encourage all interested parties to give it a try. There will be turn-back options at the 5, 10 and 16 mile mark, creating loops of 10, 20 and 32 miles. And you have most of the day to complete the ride.
There will be great support along the journey thanks to sponsor Mike’s Bikes, including three well-stocked energizer stations, ride leaders and sweeps, and mechanics to help with minor repairs.
What: An endurance ride, with 10, 20, 32 and 45 mile options
When: Sunday, September 9, 2012  (Beginner start 6 am, Intermediate start 7 am, Advanced start 8 am)
Where: Point Bonita YMCA Conference Center, 981 Fort Barry, Sausalito, CA 94956
Registration fee:  $65 - Includes well supported ride complete with SAG and energizer stations, a BBQ feast with Lagunitas beer and a Mt. Tam Dirt Fondo t-shirt (limited supply, still available as of 7/30).
More information
MCBC is launching the ride on the 100th anniversary of Mt. Tamalpais. It was in 1911 that visionary William Kent donated the land for a park and watershed. Kent also save Muir Woods and probably did more than any one person to encourage the purchase of land for parks and open space in Marin County. Without William Kent, Mt. Tam may not have become the cradle of mountain biking.
Start / Finish - The event will start and finish at the Point Bonita YMCA Conference Center, which is situated between the historic Point Bonita Light House and Nike Missile Site. Registration and post-ride expo and BBQ will all take place on the Conference Center grounds.
Route – The epic route will take riders on a journey across three parks, starting in the Marin Headlands (GGNRA) and traveling north to Mt. Tamalpais (California State Park and MMWD) before returning to the Point Bonita YMCA conference center. The route will take riders on scenic fire roads, including Miwok, Deer Park, Bobcat and Old Rail Road Grade; and some of the best trails in Marin, including Old Springs, Coast View, Dias Ridge and Middle Green Gulch. There is just one route for all riders. It is a series of intersecting crossover loops. If you do the entire route it is a 46-mile ride. You can turn back at key locations for shorter ride options. Complete route details will be distributed to participants before the event.
Support - The ride will have incredible support, with three well-stocked energizer stations, trail marshals and roving mechanics.
Post-ride BBQ - We will draw on Marin&#39;s many organic beef, dairy and produce companies to supply top quality foods for our BBQ feast. There will also be a variety of beverages, including Lagunitas Brewing craft beers.
Proceeds benefit the Marin County Bicycle Coalition&#39;s Off-road program.

CrossFit Moxie is announcing the second year of team competition at the Moxie Madness Throwdown!
Fueled by the success of the first event, CrossFit Moxie is proud to bring to you the second year of team competition at Moxie Madness.  As growth drove the demand for more space, this year Moxie Madness will be partially held at facilities that can accommodate the growth that you all have inspired.  All of this space will allow for more teams, more spectators and most importantly more opportunity for you to show off your CrossFit skills to the Northern California CrossFit Community.
The field that was 36 teams last year will grow to 55 this year. With 20 Novice, 20 Advanced and 15 Masters Division teams Moxie Madness will allow for multiple teams from the same gym to make sure that no one is left out.There will be 3 workouts on Saturday and 2 on Sunday.  The event sold out in just one week last year, and we expect the same this year so do not wait to register your teams!
Each gym will be allowed to enter a total of 3 teams with 1team per division. To help with the event this year we will be requiring any gym that enters a team to supply a volunteer or judge for the event. For accuracy we want to reserve the Judge&#39;s spots for Level I CrossFit Coaches or above (this is not a requirement, but Owners please consider how important our judges are to success of any and all events. Thank you.) More details will be released on volunteer opportunities in the future.Final tailgate of the season.  Let&#39;s go out big.  Saw a couple people from the group get escorted out of the park last time.  We can do better than just a couple!  The lowly Colorado Rockies are coming to town.  They must be destroyed.  It&#39;s also the best promotion of the season as the Giants website says every fan gets a 2 for 1 flight voucher from Virgin America. 
This is another 1 PM game, which means 10 AM start time for the tailgate, which worked out great weather wise this last time.  Early start means that a bloody mary bar will be an absolute must again.  In addition there will of course be kegs and jugs full of various cocktails.  Definitely will be using a different caterer this time as the taco man had some trouble at the last one with the fire marshall.  If you went to the last tailgate (June 9th) and are coming to this one, shoot me an email to sjsnider@kickballsf.com.  Will send you a code for $10 off in a sorry attempt to apologize for the food not being as ample as it should have been last time. Entry to this tailgate will definitely get you all the food and booze you can handle.
For some reason tickets were harder to come by this season than last.  I bought these tickets so long ago (sometime in 2011), but still couldn&#39;t get into the bleachers, so this time around we&#39;re in View Reserved Section 325, which in all honesty is probably a better seat for actually watching the game.
Music will be kicking out there again and there will be a bunch of tables, cups, and ping pong balls for drinking games.   Hopefully the early start will again mean less wind which is always good for beirut and flip cup.  All are welcome to attend (this is not just for kickballers and dodgeballers, it&#39;s for anyone that likes to party), so pass this invitation along. 
Here are instructions on how to get to the reserved spot and a link to a map below that.
&#34;Guests coming up 3rd St. should go left on Mission Rock (the street right before Lot A begins) and the left on Terry Francois Blvd. The tailgate spaces are located at the end of Terry Francois Blvd, right near McCovey Cove.&#34;

We hope you can make it!In Hoc,GO BEARS!
All proceeds will go to the Alpha Beta Chapter Alumni Fund.Interested in taking your cycling to the next level with clip-in pedals?  Whether you ride a road bike, mountain bike or commuter bike, clip-in pedals will help you to ride more efficiently, produce more power, especially when ascending the local hills, and be more confident in your handling by being more &#39;connected&#39; to your bike.  The rigid connection allows you to engage a better control of balance.  Imagine utilizing the power from your legs as they move up, pulling the pedal, as well as when you push down on the pedals.  Pulling up with your opposite leg while the other is pushing down creates a better distribution of the workload across both legs simultaneously.   
Ready to join us for this free clinic providing you with the tips and tricks to quickly learn how to use your clip-in pedals and how to easily and safety unclip at intersections, stop signs and refueling stops?  Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll need to do to prepare for the clinic and what you&#39;ll need to bring along to get the most out of it:
1) If you don&#39;t already own a pair of clip-in specific cycling shoes, stop by Sports Basement several days in advance to try some on, ask questions of our knowledgeable cycling staff and make your purchase so you may bring them to the clinic.  Doing this in advance will also provide enough time for your size to be located should it not be available that day.
2) Take a look at the clip-in pedal selection and discuss your options and what is recommended for your type of riding.  Purchase them if you&#39;re ready or wait for the clinic when we&#39;ll discuss your options and the comparative benefits.  If you have purchased pedals, we&#39;ll put them on your bike (if not already installed) and proceed to the parking lot to practice clipping in and out, starting and stopping and feeling comfortable and confident while riding this &#39;connected&#39; to your bike.
Bring the following gear:
- your bike
- cycling gear (helmet, riding apparel, cycling shoes and clip-in pedals)
Bike Skills 103 -- Cyclocross Skills + Tactics

This clinic is guest-coached by former National Champion Barb Howe and Matt McNamara of Sterling Sports Group.

FEARLESS: ONE WOMAN, ONE KAYAK, ONE CONTINENT.
Author Joe Glickman will be at Sports Basement to discuss his book FEARLESS: ONE WOMAN, ONE KAYAK, ONE CONTINENT
“Freya Hoffmeister’s voyage was bold, ambitious, and reckless—like so many of the truly great adventures!” –Bear Grylls, author of Mud, Sweat, and Tears and The Kid Who Climbed Everest

Fearless is the story of a remarkable individual who accepts no personal limits—including fear. Freya Hoffmeister, a forty-six-year-old former sky diver, gymnast, marksman, and Miss Germany contestant, left her twelve-year-old son behind to paddle alone and unsupported around Australia—a year-long adventure that virtually every expert guaranteed would get her killed. She was determined not only to survive the 9,420-mile trip through huge, shark-infested seas, but to do it faster than the one other paddler to have completed the circuit, twenty-seven years earlier.

Journalist and expert kayaker Joe Glickman details the voyage, capturing interminable days on the water and nights camped out on deserted islands, hair-raising encounters with crocs and great white sharks, and the daring 350-mile open-ocean crossing that shaved three weeks off her trip. For 332 days he followed Freya’s journey on her blog—along with a far-flung audience of awestruck, even lovesick, groupies—as she took on one terrifying ordeal after the next. In the end, he says, “Her vanity and pigheadedness paled next to her nearly superhuman ability to master fear and persevere.”

Background:
Joe Glickman is a recipient of the Lowell Thomas Award for travel writing. His work has appeared in Outside, Men’s Journal, National Geographic Adventure, Backpacker, Canoe &amp; Kayak, and leading national newspapers. His books include To the Top and The Kayak Companion. A two-time member of the U.S. National Marathon Kayak Team, he lives in Brooklyn, New York. Bike Skills 102 -- Fundamental Mountain Bike Skills

It&#39;s time for a little dirty fun! We&#39;ll teach you the basics (and not-so-basics) of balance, weight distribution, and how to use the terrain to your advantage. Learn to rock, roll, hop, and jump. Master the art of steep climbs. Learn to descend with confidence and skill. After just four hours, we guarantee you&#39;ll be a better bike handler and have much more fun on the bike. You&#39;ll need a mountain bike or a cyclocross bike for this clinic. 

This clinic is guest-coached by Ron Castia of Wenzel Coaching.

PhysioEmoDynamics Institute offers Emotional Fitness &amp; EmoYoga retreats to put an end to the way how fears, doubts and repressed emotion rule our lives.

More details about the program:
 PhysioEmoDynamics Institute launches Emotional Fitness &amp; EmoYoga retreats in The San Francisco Bay Area, Northern Caifornia. Trainers are available to travel at clients’ location.
”Emotional flexibility in these challenging times is the most important of the many physical benefits available in yoga practice and it is time for the method and classes where it is taught that way. I am thrilled to partner with PhysioEmoDynamics Institute and enthusiastically responded to Olga’s proposal to collaborate. It seems appropriate it is happening in Northern California where technology is the focal point, that we repurpose yoga as a human technology to rewire the stinking thinking that is killing us and learn techniques to escape the tyranny of our emotions. Olga brings her proven ability to innovate to the wellness industry with her revolutionary and widely scalable Emotional Fitness program. Combining PhysioEmoDynamics techniques with traditional yoga practices that I have been teaching for more than 20 years is an exciting opportunity to expand my transformational approach to yoga. We are admitting emotions drive us, and that understanding and learning how to effectively process emotions and the patterns that drive them is key to taking back the keys to our lives. Our experiments show amazing success in changing emotional awareness. It seems that together we have designed a yoga method that stretches both the body and emotional apparatus.  I have been successfully running the Yoga Center of Los Gatos for almost 11 years, offering yoga as a gift back to the Silicon Valley community for all that was given to me while I was broadcasting and serving in political office.  Now, after watching the effects of stress in our lives rob people of their freedoms and joy, and doing lots of personal growth work in ManKind Project circles, I am thrilled to introduce new opportunities to my schedule offering emotion based holistic classes co-taught by Olga and myself at the Center, as well as retreats that we have designed for you.”
Jan  Hutchins, former mayor of Los Gatos, of the Yoga Center Of Los Gatos

“Emotional and mental therapy is not only found in the therapists’ chair it’s a life style, and our mission is to take emotional and mental therapy from the therapists’ chair to the streets, where emotional health is needed the most, to eliminate violence at its root cause. While designing PhysioEmoDynamics System I drew  upon my  technology background that hinges on algorithms and patterns recognition, as well as experience with many different healing modalities, such as TFT – Thought Field Therapy, EFT – Emotional Freedom Technique, NLP – Neuro-Linguistic Programming, EMDR – Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, Dynamic Meditation, Tantra, BDSM and Status Play, Applied Kinesiology, Pranic Massage, Acupressure, Cognitive Psychology, Theta-Healing, Reiki, Vipassana mediation, Regressive Hypnosis, Somatic Experiencing, Matrix Energetics, Pranayama, and what is the most important - my personal, profound experiences of states of no-Self known in the East as non-duality, that contributed to seeing the world without distortions, without lenses of perception, without self-imposed and imposed by the society stories that imprison us. My vocation is to set humanity free – free from the mind. This might be unattainable dream, but that’s what dreams are for.  I am thrilled to join forces with Mr.Hutchins to dream the world that is free from pain.”
Olga Kostrova, serial entrepreneur, artist, founder of the PhysioEmoDynamics Institute

During PhysioEmoDynamics private sessions, as well as Emotional Fitness &amp; EmoYoga cllasses, there are four major steps in the process of permanently releasing the stored tension and energetic blockages:

Identification of emotional blockages through cognitive exercises, muscle testing and probing acupressure points.
Intensification of emotions through breath exercises and specific physical movements.
Liberation of emotional blockages through various forms of dynamic meditation and activation of acupressure points.
Integration of new emotional states with various techniques that employ visual, audio and kinesthetic components added to exercises.

PhysioEmoDynamics (PED) uses a blend of physical, emotional, energetic, and cognitive healing techniques to intuitively and rapidly resolve the root cause of pain, suffering, and illness. The PhysioEmoDynamics Method does this by activating and enhancing our own minds’ natural self-healing abilities to untangle self-defeating neural clusters and re-architect mental structures. With PhysioEmoDynamics, the you can achieve a RAPID, even IMMEDIATE, personal transformation without the use of medication or drugs and their related side-effects, both short- and long-term. Emotional Fitness program is VERY COST-EFFECTIVE solution compared to engaging in months or years of therapy–often yielding noticeable changes in the client’s emotional and physical state during the first session. The PhysioEmoDynamics System employs intuitive, compassionate touch and kinesthetic modalities to create a pleasant sensory experience during each session.

 Interested in taking your cycling to the next level with clip-in pedals?  Whether you ride a road bike, mountain bike or commuter bike, clip-in pedals will help you to ride more efficiently, produce more power, especially when ascending the local hills, and be more confident in your handling by being more &#39;connected&#39; to your bike.  The rigid connection allows you to engage a better control of balance.  Imagine utilizing the power from your legs as they move up, pulling the pedal, as well as when you push down on the pedals.  Pulling up with your opposite leg while the other is pushing down creates a better distribution of the workload across both legs simultaneously.   
Ready to join us for this free clinic providing you with the tips and tricks to quickly learn how to use your clip-in pedals and how to easily and safety unclip at intersections, stop signs and refueling stops?  Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll need to do to prepare for the clinic and what you&#39;ll need to bring along to get the most out of it:
1) If you don&#39;t already own a pair of clip-in specific cycling shoes, stop by Sports Basement several days in advance to try some on, ask questions of our knowledgeable cycling staff and make your purchase so you may bring them to the clinic.  Doing this in advance will also provide enough time for your size to be located should it not be available that day.
2) Take a look at the clip-in pedal selection and discuss your options and what is recommended for your type of riding.  Purchase them if you&#39;re ready or wait for the clinic when we&#39;ll discuss your options and the comparative benefits.  If you have purchased pedals, we&#39;ll put them on your bike (if not already installed) and proceed to the parking lot to practice clipping in and out, starting and stopping and feeling comfortable and confident while riding this &#39;connected&#39; to your bike.

30 second spot: http://youtu.be/MA4VOWdHcgIOBA is pleased to announce the return of Super Skills Clinics - a place for all players to improve their baseball skill sets. Under the supervision of our Pony coaching staff, we will be offering, on a weekly basis, age and skill specific clinics. These clinics will take place on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays beginning the week of September 11th running through the week of October 22nd. NEW THIS YEAR: the clinics will be offered to 8-9, 10 and 11 year olds with each age group assigned a specific day and time to be consistent throughout the program.
Only sign up for the age group that your player will be in for the Spring 2013 league:
 
Tuesdays: 8-9&#39;s from 4-5:30pm at Wagner Mustang Field
Wednesdays: 10&#39;s from 4-5:30pm at Wagner Mustang Field
Thursdays: 11&#39;s from 4-5:30pm at Wagner Bronco Field
 

Each week will have a different focus. Areas of concentration will include: Outfield, Infield, Hitting, Pitching, Catching, Base Running and Throwing.
You can sign up for as many clinics as you&#39;d like. Unfortunately, the ticketing software we use doesn&#39;t allow you to purchase tickets on multiple days so you&#39;ll have to do separate transactions. Clinics will be $20/player/clinic. We will need a minimum of 5 kids/clinic with a maximum of 12 kids/clinic. It will be on a first come/first served basis and is available to everyone, whether you are playing Fall Ball or not. We think this will prove to be a high quality baseball learning experience

 In Brazil the Brazilian National Championship by Teams is  one of the main attractions of the CBJJ annual calendar. Athletes and fans agree that the team format is very exciting! For the athletes this is one of the few competitions where they are competing for their academies/teams not just association and themselves. As a result this creates a unique atmosphere. For supporters and fans this event is like no other. Although it’s great to cheer for your association at the bigger events (Pan Ams/Worlds) it’s even more special to support some one who trains at your own academy daily! To cheer for your team, like in any other sport, is both fun and exhilarating.
Thanks to (Insert name here) this format is coming to the US!  Each team is made of up to four competitors; three of which are starters while the other one is a reserve. When it is time to face an opposing team, each team coach privately numbers their fighters from 1 to 3. Fighters who are given the same numbers will fight each other (1 against 1, 2 against 2 and so on). The team that scores two wins out of three matches advances in the competition. This makes it possible for a weaker team to beat a stronger team with strategy!!!
It is easy to understand the success of this formula, after all it allows an athlete to move on in the competition even if he loses his match. Strategy is very important and in the end a weaker team can beat a much stronger team. In Brazil the highlight of the event isn’t who wins but the feeling of union and team work that grows among the athletes. Everyone focuses on supporting their teammates so that they all can advance in the competition. It is quite common to witness battles where a team starts losing but rallies back to take the bracket. The fans also get a different feeling out of their cheering, since it’s team against team – or in this case, school versus school – just like in any other team sport such as football, basketball or baseball.
In addition to the team challenge there will also be Kid divisions with the same rules, regulations and guidelines as the IBJJF.Pardres at Giants

Los Angeles, CA 90083Leading US motorsports tour operator Grand Prix Tours announces new tours to the United States Grand Prix in Austin.   After years of waiting, on December 7th the FIA and F1 Management has awarded a ten year contract to Circuits of the Americas to hold the United States Grand Prix in Austin, Texas.  
Just like a child in eager anticipation counting down the days until Christmas, US F1 fans have been anxiously awaiting the return of the USGP and the only place fitting for a USGP comeback is Texas!  As the saying goes, &#34;Everything is bigger in Texas - big money, big cars and big hair - so it’s only fitting that a bigger-than-ever USGP would happen in Austin, Texas.
We hear so often that Formula 1 is not something that will catch on in the States.  But when you look at the facts the United States is clearly a market for F1.  There are more American drivers who have taken part in F1 than any other nationality.  At least six American teams have competed in F1.  Nine tracks have hosted F1 races in the US.  If this is not enough we have two new tracks with 10 year contracts to hold F1 in the United States.  All we need now is a World Champion and F1 will be a major player in the US.  
Grand Prix Tours is currently the only operator to offer a trip to the inaugural Austin Grand Prix race in November 2012.  Race Preview Party is not included with the 3 night package. Race tickets are not included with your hotel package. As this is a new venue, ticket information is still not available.  If you book with us, we will automatically contact you as soon as details are released.
Known as the Live Music Capitol of the World, Austin is vibrant and modern yet laidback and artistic offering a little something for everyone which speaks well for an international race. 2012 will be an exciting year as the Formula 1 United States Grand Prix returns to America after a 4 year absence. Join us for this exciting moment in history!

 The 1st Annual Fastpitch TV Coaches Clinic 
For over 10 years I have been telling people that I need to host a coaches clinic, so I am finally going to do it.
I am not hosting this clinic because I know a lot about the game, or because I am a great coach. I am hosting this clinic because I know the right people, and how to set up the right environment for a great clinic.
My goal is to create a high quality training clinic for fastpitch softball coaches of all levels. If you are a high school, travel ball, or even college coach you will learn something from this clinic. To round out the learning opportunity educational books, and DVDs will be available at the clinic.

ALL SALE ARE FINALE NO REFUNDSNick Figaro was born August 6, 1975 and his life came to an abrupt end on the morning of December 14, 2010.  That day will forever be embedded in the hearts and minds of all that knew and loved Nick.  He was a beloved husband, a loving father, a devoted brother and son, and a caring friend.  He effortlessly could bring a smile to your face by either cracking a witty joke or by simply flashing his genuine smile.  Words cannot capture the impact he left on us all.   He gave each of us something special which we will always carry with us and now the time has come for us to give back to him.  
Please join us in celebrating Nick’s life with family and friends at the Second Annual Nick Figaro Golf Outing.  All proceeds from the golf outing will go towards The Sloan Figaro Trust.  There will be a silent auction and raffle held at the dinner after golf just like last year.  We look forward to a fun filled day and thank you for your kindness and support.

The school that sells the most tickets receives bragging rights on the North Side for a year - and the ceremonial first pitch. If Michigan State WINS - Sparty will throw out the first pitch from Wrigley Field. A Big Ten and Michigan State FIRST.

About &#34;Crazy Pat&#34;: 
 
Patrick Reilly McManus, known as “Crazy Pat” to his many friends, was a loving son, brother and friend.  Pat died on December 7, 1988 at age 22 after being hit by a car in Chicago.  Anyone lucky enough to call Crazy Pat their friend will never forget him.  He knew what it meant to be a true friend – loyal, supportive and loving.  If you were down or hurting, Pat was the first person there with a word of encouragement or offer to help.  If you had good news, Pat was the first person there to celebrate it with you.  Crazy Pat loved to laugh and had an enthusiasm and love of life which were rare and infectious.  He was a leader in both word and deed.  
 
Pat died far too young but truly lived a life to admire for all of his 22 years and touched the lives of many people.   He grew up in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, the son of Arthur and Terry McManus along with his two brothers Arthur (“Mick”) and Dave.  Pat attended the University of Notre Dame where he was the captain of the swim team.  Pat graduated from Notre Dame in May, 1988 and lived in Chicago where he worked for Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance.

Junior Sailing - Session 4 - Beginning, Intermediate and Advanced Levels

Class times: Monday - Friday, August 6th to August 10th
                  Morning classes are from 8:30 a.m. to 11:45 p.m.
                  Afternoon classes are from 1:15 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.
 
Junior Sailing Programs offer a range of classes for ages 8 to 18. Sailor’s progress through a series of four levels: Beginning, Intermediate, Advanced and Racing Team. This progressive approach is designed to help each sailor make exciting improvements while still having a lot of fun. Sailors are continually evaluated on the water to ensure that they are learning skills necessary to progress to the next level. The Junior Sailing Program’s priorities are to provide safe and fun instruction that develops the participant’s sailing skills and enthusiasm for the sport. Our courses incorporate standards from both U.S. Sailing and Canadian Yachting Associations. These programs primarily use Prams, Optimists or 420s for instruction; the boat used depends on a student’s ability and physical size.
Beginning Sailing
Beginning sailing is for students who have never sailed or have little sailing experience. The class teaches boating safety, knots and boat parts. Students also learn beginning steering, points of sail, maneuvers, and how to get a boat to and from a dock and a mooring.
Intermediate Sailing
Intermediate Sailing is for students who have beginning sailing skills, but still lack the experience to sail on their own. At this level, students learn additional knots and boat parts as well as develop confidence to steer a boat on their own. Additionally, basic rules of the road and basic seamanship are taught. Intermediate Sailing focuses on mastering independent, confident boat handling. By the end of the course, a student should be able to rig and sail a boat without instructor assistance.
Advanced Sailing
In Advanced Sailing students begin learning sailing theory and basic racing. Students are also introduced to spinnaker and trapeze use on 420s. Advanced Optimist sailors are introduced to sail and boat set up specific to that boat. Instructors teach advanced boat handling techniques, sail trim and cover beginning racing rules and tactics. By the end of Advanced Sailing a student should be ready to race.
Important Requirements
Each student must have a U.S. Coast Guard approved type III life jacket; rubber-soled, closed-toe shoes; sunscreen, and a water bottle. Also, students must be able to swim 50 yards. If you need assistance in knowing what sailing equipment to buy or where to buy it, please call the Sailing School, we are happy to help. Medical and waiver forms must be signed prior to the start of classes.
Directions, drop off/pick up instructions, Waiver and Medical forms will be emailed upon registration.Prices are higher Online due to Eventbrite and Credit Cards Fees.

HERE’S HOW IT WORKS:

After the MC provides instructions, you’re given your first set of clues that point in different directions within a 3 to 5 mile radius. Once you get to a location, you’ll find an additional slip with instructions on what to do next with your camera. It could be anything ranging from taking a simple picture with the object, singing for someone, putting together a mini-puzzle, dipping your hand in something disgusting to look for a clue or just making funny faces.
You receive your second set of clues at a random clue (not so random for us) by one of our staffers. You’ll have as much time as you need to complete 10 out of the 12 clues, with a few of the clues being challenges. Once you’ve completed your 10, you head back to the start location to win the finishing prize, redeem a ticket, or get a nice pat on the back and enjoy the live entertainment (in select cities) and food and beverage specials!
WILDCARD: If you see any of our staffers in a Gorilla outfit running around downtown, chase them as fast as possible! They’ve got prizes to give away to any team that can catch them. Please don’t maul, tackle, jump on, or run them over.
PRIZES? SAY WHAT?
First place = $300 for the team Second place = $200 for the team Third place = $100 for the team
Best costume = $50 Runner-up = $25
Food Drive Challenge = $100

 Come out and see what fencing and the club is all about. If you have no experience or years of experience the open house is a great way to see how the club works and meet the members. Both adults and children 8 and older are welcome.
At the open house we will have an intro practice that you can participate in for free, so prepare for a workout. We will also explain more about fencing and the club. If you don&#39;t want to get sweaty you can stop by and see what&#39;s going on. If you have fun and want to continue you can sign up for the beginner&#39;s class, starting on September 9, or for more advanced lessons.
I have been a member of the club for two years, and I&#39;m always looking for more people to play swords with. Fencing is a fun and exiting way to get exercise. I enjoy fencing because it&#39;s not just a mindless sport, you have to think about and set up your points. The people in the club are friendly and welcoming to new members. Our coach is very experienced and pushes you just the right amount.
Please use Contact the Host for more info or with questions.

 ►  $30*  ►  2 hours  ►  All Ages

*You will need a CTA subway ticket or $2.25/person for fare
In their early days, Chicago&#39;s alternative rock stars were drawn to the neighborhood around Wrigley Field, the home of the Chicago Cubs, to live and play music. Believe it or not, the gentrification of the neighborhood, the skyrocketing popularity of the Cubs during the 1980s, and the birth of the Smashing Pumpkins are all linked. 
Until a community of artists planted roots around Wrigley Field, it was a largely ethnic neighborhood of working-class families. As more artists moved in, more music venues opened. When young urban professionals joined the ranks, the neighborhood was transformed into &#34;Wrigleyville,&#34; the bustling metro area you see today. 
This tour explores the history of the neighborhood from a unique vantage point, and gives you a taste of Chicago&#39;s finest treasures along the way:

► Walk the perimeter of Wrigley Field and check out the legendary watering holes, rooftop bleachers, and enchanted history that make it so unique


► Visit past and present music clubs where Bob Marley, Prince, REM, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, and Pearl Jam played


► Ride the elevated subway system known as The &#34;L&#34; between the two stations that link the original rock and baseball worlds


► Visit the best souvenir shops for rock and Cubs memorabilia


► Check out the famous 50-year-old bar named Best Rock Club in Chicago, #1 Neighborhood Bar by Maxim magazine, and 7th Best Sports Bar in the U.S. by Sports Illustrated

Meet us at the Belmont &#34;L&#34; station  next to the Never Mind store window on Belmont Avenue. We&#39;ll gather at about 12:45 pm and begin the tour promptly at 1 pm. Bring a CTA subway pass or $2.25/person for fare. This ticket includes a 12% City of Chicago Amusement Tax.

 Rings and Power is a high-performance upper body training system to build muscle, strength and flexibility using nothing but gymnastics rings.  You will learn the precise technique of the high-tension rings exercises and you’ll unleash the hidden power that’s holding you back from developing the body you always wanted. Master the 5 essential rings exercises you’ll sculpt a physique that’s as powerful as it looks.
Chad Waterbury will teach you how to teach and  master the five essential rings exercises.
Muscle-up
Front lever
Back lever
Iron cross
Handstand push-up
Rings training is the quintessential upper body strength workout and here are three reasons why:
- More muscle: the type of high-tension contraction you get with rings training can’t be matched with any traditional dumbbell or barbell exercise.  The high-tension contractions quickly recruit the high-threshold motor units that are crucial for adding lean muscle.
- More strength: the instability of the rings, paired with the high-tension contractions, builds the type of powerful strength that necessary for any hard training athlete.
- More flexibility: the unrestricted freedom of rings training allows your joints to move in ways that are easiest on your joints, while also improving range of motion and joint health.
Chad will teach specific “peel backs” for each of the big 5 exercises. Very few people are strong enough to do the advanced exercises, that’s why it’s important to have a series of strength exercises so you and your clients can systematically progress toward the elite moves.
